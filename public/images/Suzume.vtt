Where's Daijin?

00:51:11.485 --> 00:51:11.819
Gone. Again.

Gone. Again.

00:51:17.116 --> 00:51:18.075
Let's go inside.

00:51:21.704 --> 00:51:22.830
What's wrong?

00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:23.414
I was so scared!

Suzume...

00:51:35.718 --> 00:51:36.051
What were you looking at, beyond the Gate?

00:51:36.051 --> 00:51:36.385
What were you looking at, beyond the Gate?

00:51:36.385 --> 00:51:36.719

00:51:40.556 --> 00:51:40.889
A bright night sky filled with stars and fields...

"Ever-After"?

00:51:48.939 --> 00:51:49.273
This world's other half, where the worm dwells.

00:51:49.273 --> 00:51:49.607
This world's other half, where the worm dwells.

00:51:49.607 --> 00:51:49.940

And, where all time exists simultaneously.

00:51:52.067 --> 00:51:52.401
And, where all time exists simultaneously.

00:51:52.401 --> 00:51:52.735

I could see it, but I couldn't go in.

00:51:55.112 --> 00:51:56.280

Not a place we're supposed to go.

00:52:05.164 --> 00:52:05.497
Not a place we're supposed to go.

00:52:05.497 --> 00:52:05.831

00:52:08.834 --> 00:52:09.168
The troublemaker's back.

00:52:09.168 --> 00:52:09.501
The troublemaker's back.

00:52:09.501 --> 00:52:09.835
The troublemaker's back.

00:52:09.835 --> 00:52:10.878
The troublemaker's back.

00:52:11.587 --> 00:52:11.920
Suzume, where were you!?

00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:12.254
Suzume, where were you!?

00:52:12.254 --> 00:52:12.588
Suzume, where were you!?

00:52:12.588 --> 00:52:13.922
Suzume, where were you!?

00:52:14.048 --> 00:52:14.381
Oh, um... I'm sorry.

00:52:14.381 --> 00:52:14.715
Oh, um... I'm sorry.

00:52:14.715 --> 00:52:15.799
Oh, um... I'm sorry.

00:52:15.924 --> 00:52:16.258
You had me worried sick! Running off at this hour.

00:52:16.258 --> 00:52:16.592
You had me worried sick! Running off at this hour.

00:52:16.592 --> 00:52:16.925

You had me worried sick! Running off at this hour.

00:52:18.677 --> 00:52:19.011
Well, she's all right, isn't she?

00:52:19.011 --> 00:52:19.345
Well, she's all right, isn't she?

00:52:19.345 --> 00:52:20.387
Well, she's all right, isn't she?

00:52:20.512 --> 00:52:21.805
But—!

00:52:21.930 --> 00:52:22.264
How many times have we run away from home?

00:52:22.264 --> 00:52:22.598
How many times have we run away from home?

00:52:22.598 --> 00:52:22.931

00:52:23.265 --> 00:52:24.308
How many times have we run away from home?

00:52:28.437 --> 00:52:28.771
Why don't we have a bite for now.

00:52:28.771 --> 00:52:29.104
Why don't we have a bite for now.

00:52:29.104 --> 00:52:29.438

Sorry...

00:52:33.025 --> 00:52:34.318
How about fried udon?

00:52:34.443 --> 00:52:34.777
Yeah! With a sunny side up on top.

00:52:34.777 --> 00:52:35.110

Yeah.

00:52:38.072 --> 00:52:39.031
And you, Suzume?

00:52:39.156 --> 00:52:39.490
We actually put potato salad on top.

00:52:39.490 --> 00:52:39.823
We actually put potato salad on top.

00:52:39.823 --> 00:52:41.116

00:52:41.909 --> 00:52:43.077

00:52:44.662 --> 00:52:44.995
O-M-G.

00:52:44.995 --> 00:52:46.246
O-M-G.

00:52:47.164 --> 00:52:47.498
Think about the calories.

00:52:47.498 --> 00:52:47.831
Think about the calories.

00:52:47.831 --> 00:52:49.041

00:52:49.166 --> 00:52:49.500
S000 hungry.

S000 hungry.

00:52:51.126 --> 00:52:52.336
Thanks for the meal!

00:52:56.382 --> 00:52:56.715
Delish!

00:52:56.715 --> 00:52:57.800
Delish!

00:52:57.925 --> 00:52:58.967
I'll gain some weight.

00:52:59.093 --> 00:52:59.843
Needs a beer!

00:53:00.177 --> 00:53:00.844
Should we?

00:53:01.387 --> 00:53:01.720
After drinking all night?

00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:02.971
After drinking all night?

00:53:03.222 --> 00:53:04.098
Sure, why not?

00:53:04.306 --> 00:53:04.640
Join us, Souta.

00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:05.808
Join us, Souta.

00:53:05.933 --> 00:53:06.266
Didn't expect the potato salad, though.

00:53:06.266 --> 00:53:06.600
Didn't expect the potato salad, though.

00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:07.893

00:53:08.018 --> 00:53:08.102
I'm making this for my boyfriend.

00:53:09.436 --> 00:53:09.770
What boyfriend?

00:53:09.770 --> 00:53:10.854
What boyfriend?

00:53:10.979 --> 00:53:11.313
I'll have one in no time.

00:53:11.313 --> 00:53:12.398
I'll have one in no time.

00:53:12.731 --> 00:53:13.065
What's with that chair?

00:53:13.065 --> 00:53:14.108
What's with that chair?

00:53:14.233 --> 00:53:15.275
Adorable.

00:53:15.401 --> 00:53:16.276
A kid's chair?

00:53:16.402 --> 00:53:17.736
Why are you on it?

00:53:17.861 --> 00:53:18.946
A Kobe souvenir...?

00:53:19.071 --> 00:53:19.405
You're not making any sense.

00:53:19.405 --> 00:53:20.614
You're not making any sense.

00:53:26.578 --> 00:53:26.912
They must've thought you were weird.

00:53:26.912 --> 00:53:27.246
They must've thought you were weird.

00:53:27.246 --> 00:53:28.372
They must've thought you were weird.

00:53:28.664 --> 00:53:29.998
Really?

00:53:30.165 --> 00:53:30.499
Do you travel like this all the time?

00:53:30.499 --> 00:53:30.833

00:53:33.919 --> 00:53:34.920
Not all the time.

00:53:35.129 --> 00:53:35.462
I have a flat in Tokyo.

00:53:35.462 --> 00:53:36.505
I have a flat in Tokyo.

00:53:37.381 --> 00:53:37.715

00:53:41.802 --> 00:53:42.136
What!? You're a university student?

00:53:42.136 --> 00:53:42.469

00:53:43.887 --> 00:53:44.638
Yeah?

00:53:44.930 --> 00:53:45.723
And...a job!?

00:53:45.848 --> 00:53:47.141
What about THIS job!?

00:53:47.266 --> 00:53:47.599
Being a Closer has been in my family for generations.

00:53:47.599 --> 00:53:47.933

00:53:50.602 --> 00:53:51.812
I'll continue that.

00:53:52.646 --> 00:53:52.980
But it doesn't put food on the table.

00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:53.313
But it doesn't put food on the table.

00:53:53.313 --> 00:53:54.565
But it doesn't put food on the table.

00:53:54.690 --> 00:53:55.983
I see...

00:53:56.608 --> 00:53:57.901
But it's an important job.

00:53:58.402 --> 00:53:58.736
Most important jobs, people shouldn't see.

00:53:58.736 --> 00:53:59.069

00:53:59.069 --> 00:53:59.403

00:54:02.614 --> 00:54:02.948
I need to get back into my own body.

00:54:02.948 --> 00:54:03.282
I need to get back into my own body.

00:54:03.282 --> 00:54:03.615

00:54:05.033 --> 00:54:05.367
So I can continue this and become a teacher.

00:54:05.367 --> 00:54:05.701
So I can continue this and become a teacher.

00:54:05.701 --> 00:54:06.034

00:54:06.702 --> 00:54:07.870
So I can continue this and become a teacher.

00:54:12.374 --> 00:54:12.708
But... I'm already...

00:54:12.708 --> 00:54:14.001
But... I'm already...

00:54:19.923 --> 00:54:21.258
Perhaps, I'm...

00:54:22.342 --> 00:54:22.676
already...

00:54:22.676 --> 00:54:23.010
already...

00:54:23.010 --> 00:54:23.343

already...

00:54:31.727 --> 00:54:32.060
It's getting farther.

00:54:32.060 --> 00:54:32.394
It's getting farther.

00:54:32.394 --> 00:54:33.562
It's getting farther.

00:54:34.021 --> 00:54:34.354
The light grows dimmer.

00:54:34.354 --> 00:54:34.688
The light grows dimmer.

00:54:34.688 --> 00:54:35.814
The light grows dimmer.

00:54:36.023 --> 00:54:36.356
And so do the voices.

00:54:36.356 --> 00:54:37.691
And so do the voices.

00:54:37.983 --> 00:54:38.317
My body...

00:54:38.317 --> 00:54:39.610
My body...

00:54:40.027 --> 00:54:40.360
My mind...

00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:41.487
My mind...

00:54:43.238 --> 00:54:44.406
It's so...

00:54:44.656 --> 00:54:45.574
Cold.

00:54:45.908 --> 00:54:46.867
I'm so cold.

00:54:46.992 --> 00:54:47.326
Cold...

00:54:47.326 --> 00:54:47.659
Cold...

00:54:47.659 --> 00:54:47.993
Cold...

00:54:47.993 --> 00:54:48.327
Cold...

00:54:48.327 --> 00:54:49.536
Cold...

00:55:05.052 --> 00:55:06.053
Am I...

00:55:18.148 --> 00:55:19.483
Is this where...

00:55:19.691 --> 00:55:20.025
I meet my end?

00:55:20.025 --> 00:55:21.235
I meet my end?

00:55:30.285 --> 00:55:30.619

00:55:30.619 --> 00:55:31.703
Souta?

00:55:32.663 --> 00:55:33.997

00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:41.213
Good morning.

00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:42.714
Took you long enough.

00:55:42.881 --> 00:55:43.215
Hey, there's another photo of Daijin.

00:55:43.215 --> 00:55:43.549

00:55:54.059 --> 00:55:55.018
Nope.

00:55:56.186 --> 00:55:56.687

Ah, crap!

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:18.333
I totally forgot about Tamaki.

00:56:18.333 --> 00:56:18.667
I totally forgot about Tamaki.

00:56:18.667 --> 00:56:19.793

00:56:34.016 --> 00:56:35.309
To Tokyo, though?

00:56:35.434 --> 00:56:35.767
That'll take all my savings.

00:56:35.767 --> 00:56:37.102

Why?

01:13:45.046 --> 01:13:45.379

She's not wearing any shoes.

01:15:27.732 --> 01:15:28.065
You're right. Ew.

01:15:28.065 --> 01:15:28.399

Is she barefoot?

01:15:39.368 --> 01:15:40.244
For real?

01:15:42.538 --> 01:15:42.872

I wanted nothing more than to go myself...

01:16:36.342 --> 01:16:36.675
but this old body of mine wouldn't listen.

01:16:36.675 --> 01:16:37.009

That's why I want to know how to enter the Ever-After.

01:16:43.265 --> 01:16:43.599
That's why I want to know how to enter the Ever-After.

01:16:43.599 --> 01:16:44.934
That's why I want to know how to enter the Ever-After.

01:16:47.061 --> 01:16:48.062
Why?

01:16:48.395 --> 01:16:48.729
Huh? Because... we have to save Soutal!

01:16:48.729 --> 01:16:49.063
Huh? Because... we have to save Soutal!

01:16:49.063 --> 01:16:49.396
Huh? Because... we have to save Soutal!

01:16:49.396 --> 01:16:50.564
Huh? Because... we have to save Soutal!

01:16:50.689 --> 01:16:51.023
That isn't necessary.

01:16:51.023 --> 01:16:51.357
That isn't necessary.

01:16:51.357 --> 01:16:52.525
That isn't necessary.

01:16:52.650 --> 01:16:53.567
What?

01:16:53.692 --> 01:16:54.026
Souta will spend decades now

01:16:54.026 --> 01:16:54.360
Souta will spend decades now

01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:54.693

01:16:57.196 --> 01:16:57.530
as a Keystone housing the gods.

01:16:57.530 --> 01:16:57.863
as a Keystone housing the gods.

01:16:57.863 --> 01:16:58.197

01:16:58.864 --> 01:16:59.198
as a Keystone housing the gods.

01:16:59.198 --> 01:16:59.532
as a Keystone housing the gods.

01:16:59.532 --> 01:17:00.741
as a Keystone housing the gods.

01:17:00.866 --> 01:17:01.200
He is no longer of our realm.

01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:01.534
He is no longer of our realm.

He is no longer of our realm.

01:17:04.578 --> 01:17:05.830
How could...

01:17:05.955 --> 01:17:07.123
But there must be a way to—

01:17:07.248 --> 01:17:07.581
Are you trying to waste my grandson's sacrifice?

01:17:07.581 --> 01:17:07.915
Are you trying to waste my grandson's sacrifice?

01:17:07.915 --> 01:17:08.249

01:17:08.582 --> 01:17:08.916
Are you trying to waste my grandson's sacrifice?

01:17:08.916 --> 01:17:09.250
Are you trying to waste my grandson's sacrifice?

01:17:09.250 --> 01:17:09.583
Are you trying to waste my grandson's sacrifice?

01:17:09.583 --> 01:17:09.917
Are you trying to waste my grandson's sacrifice?

01:17:09.917 --> 01:17:11.085
Are you trying to waste my grandson's sacrifice?

01:17:11.210 --> 01:17:12.086
What?

01:17:12.211 --> 01:17:12.545
Who is the one who pierced the worm?

01:17:12.545 --> 01:17:12.878
Who is the one who pierced the worm?

01:17:12.878 --> 01:17:13.212
Who is the one who pierced the worm?

01:17:13.212 --> 01:17:13.546
Who is the one who pierced the worm?

01:17:13.546 --> 01:17:13.879
Who is the one who pierced the worm?

01:17:13.879 --> 01:17:15.047
Who is the one who pierced the worm?

01:17:15.297 --> 01:17:15.631
Did you, with Souta?

01:17:15.631 --> 01:17:15.965
Did you, with Souta?

01:17:15.965 --> 01:17:16.298
Did you, with Souta?

01:17:16.298 --> 01:17:17.466
Did you, with Souta?

01:17:17.591 --> 01:17:18.342
But that was...

01:17:18.467 --> 01:17:19.593
ANSWER ME!

01:17:19.718 --> 01:17:20.594
It was me!

01:17:21.011 --> 01:17:22.304
I see.

01:17:22.429 --> 01:17:22.763
That's fine!

01:17:22.763 --> 01:17:24.056
That's fine!

01:17:24.181 --> 01:17:24.515
If you didn't, millions would have died!

01:17:24.515 --> 01:17:24.849
If you didn't, millions would have died!

01:17:24.849 --> 01:17:25.182

If you didn't, millions would have died!

01:17:26.183 --> 01:17:27.476
If you didn't, millions would have died!

01:17:27.601 --> 01:17:27.935
Take pride in your deed, keep your mouth shut,

01:17:27.935 --> 01:17:28.269
Take pride in your deed, keep your mouth shut,

01:17:28.269 --> 01:17:28.602

Take pride in your deed, keep your mouth shut,

01:17:30.729 --> 01:17:31.063
and return to whence you came!

01:17:31.063 --> 01:17:31.397
and return to whence you came!

01:17:31.397 --> 01:17:31.730
and return to whence you came!

01:17:31.730 --> 01:17:32.064
and return to whence you came!

01:17:32.064 --> 01:17:32.398
and return to whence you came!

01:17:32.398 --> 01:17:33.524
and return to whence you came!

01:17:38.904 --> 01:17:39.238
This world is not for the ordinary.

01:17:39.238 --> 01:17:39.572
This world is not for the ordinary.

01:17:39.572 --> 01:17:39.905

This world is not for the ordinary.

01:17:43.409 --> 01:17:43.742
Forget everything that happened.

01:17:43.742 --> 01:17:44.076
Forget everything that happened.

01:17:44.076 --> 01:17:44.410
Forget everything that happened.

01:17:44.410 --> 01:17:44.743
Forget everything that happened.

01:17:44.743 --> 01:17:45.077
Forget everything that happened.

01:17:45.077 --> 01:17:46.370
Forget everything that happened.

01:17:47.121 --> 01:17:47.454
How could I forget?

01:17:47.454 --> 01:17:47.788
How could I forget?

01:17:47.788 --> 01:17:49.039
How could I forget?

01:17:49.165 --> 01:17:49.498
I'll open the underground Gate again.

01:17:49.498 --> 01:17:49.832
I'll open the underground Gate again.

01:17:49.832 --> 01:17:50.166
I'll open the underground Gate again.

01:17:50.166 --> 01:17:50.499

01:17:50.499 --> 01:17:50.833
I'll open the underground Gate again.

01:17:50.833 --> 01:17:51.959
I'll open the underground Gate again.

01:17:52.084 --> 01:17:52.418
What!? What are you saying?

01:17:52.418 --> 01:17:52.751
What!? What are you saying?

01:17:52.751 --> 01:17:53.085
What!? What are you saying?

01:17:53.085 --> 01:17:54.295
What!? What are you saying?

01:17:54.420 --> 01:17:54.753
I have to get in!

01:17:54.753 --> 01:17:55.921
I have to get in!

01:17:56.046 --> 01:17:56.881
Impossible.

01:17:57.006 --> 01:17:57.339
You cannot enter it there!

01:17:57.339 --> 01:17:58.632
You cannot enter it there!

01:17:58.757 --> 01:17:59.091
You mustn't open the Gate!

01:17:59.091 --> 01:17:59.425
You mustn't open the Gate!

01:17:59.425 --> 01:17:59.758
You mustn't open the Gate!

01:17:59.758 --> 01:18:00.885
You mustn't open the Gate!

01:18:01.010 --> 01:18:02.136
Wait!

01:18:14.231 --> 01:18:14.565
The Ever-After is a beautiful place.

01:18:14.565 --> 01:18:14.899
The Ever-After is a beautiful place.

01:18:14.899 --> 01:18:15.232
The Ever-After is a beautiful place.

01:18:15.232 --> 01:18:15.566
The Ever-After is a beautiful place.

01:18:15.566 --> 01:18:16.692
The Ever-After is a beautiful place.

01:18:16.817 --> 01:18:17.151
But it is the domain of the departed.

01:18:17.151 --> 01:18:17.484
But it is the domain of the departed.

01:18:17.484 --> 01:18:18.819
But it is the domain of the departed.

01:18:19.111 --> 01:18:19.445
Does that not scare you?

01:18:19.445 --> 01:18:19.778
Does that not scare you?

01:18:19.778 --> 01:18:20.112
Does that not scare you?

01:18:20.112 --> 01:18:20.446
Does that not scare you?

01:18:20.446 --> 01:18:20.779
Does that not scare you?

01:18:20.779 --> 01:18:22.072
Does that not scare you?

01:18:22.406 --> 01:18:22.740
It doesn't.

01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:23.908
It doesn't.

01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:24.533
Whether one lives or dies is a matter of luck.

01:18:24.533 --> 01:18:24.867
Whether one lives or dies is a matter of luck.

01:18:24.867 --> 01:18:25.201

Whether one lives or dies is a matter of luck.

01:18:27.036 --> 01:18:27.369
I've always felt that way.

01:18:27.369 --> 01:18:28.662
I've always felt that way.

01:18:29.121 --> 01:18:29.914
But...

01:18:30.706 --> 01:18:31.040
I'm afraid of a world without Souta.

01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:31.373
I'm afraid of a world without Souta.

01:18:31.373 --> 01:18:31.707

01:18:33.042 --> 01:18:34.251
I'm afraid of a world without Souta.

01:18:42.718 --> 01:18:43.052

01:18:48.265 --> 01:18:48.599
You've been to the Ever-After before, no?

01:18:48.599 --> 01:18:48.933
You've been to the Ever-After before, no?

01:18:48.933 --> 01:18:49.266
You've been to the Ever-After before, no?

01:18:49.266 --> 01:18:49.600

You've been to the Ever-After before, no?

01:18:51.393 --> 01:18:51.727
What did you see there?

01:18:51.727 --> 01:18:52.061
What did you see there?

01:18:52.061 --> 01:18:52.394
What did you see there?

01:18:52.394 --> 01:18:52.728
What did you see there?

01:18:52.728 --> 01:18:53.854
What did you see there?

01:18:54.355 --> 01:18:54.688
That was...

01:18:54.688 --> 01:18:55.731
That was...

01:18:55.981 --> 01:18:56.315
A young version of myself.

01:18:56.315 --> 01:18:56.649
A young version of myself.

01:18:56.649 --> 01:18:57.733
A young version of myself.

01:18:58.234 --> 01:18:58.567
And, my mom...who passed away.

01:18:58.567 --> 01:18:58.901
And, my mom...who passed away.

01:18:58.901 --> 01:18:59.235
And, my mom...who passed away.

01:18:59.235 --> 01:18:59.568
And, my mom...who passed away.

And, my mom...who passed away.

01:33:50.166 --> 01:33:50.500
You appreciate the oldies, right, Suzume?

01:33:50.500 --> 01:33:50.834
You appreciate the oldies, right, Suzume?

01:33:50.834 --> 01:33:52.168
You appreciate the oldies, right, Suzume?

01:33:55.296 --> 01:33:55.630
Guess the rain ain't done yet...

01:33:55.630 --> 01:33:56.881
Guess the rain ain't done yet...

01:33:57.006 --> 01:33:57.924
Right, newcomer?

01:33:58.591 --> 01:33:58.925
How did we pick up another stray?

01:33:58.925 --> 01:33:59.259
How did we pick up another stray?

01:33:59.259 --> 01:33:59.592
How did we pick up another stray?

01:33:59.592 --> 01:34:00.677
How did we pick up another stray?

01:34:01.136 --> 01:34:01.469
And a huge one, at that.

01:34:01.469 --> 01:34:02.679
And a huge one, at that.

01:34:03.429 --> 01:34:04.722
Hey, a rainbow.

01:34:04.848 --> 01:34:05.181
Now there's a good sign.

01:34:05.181 --> 01:34:05.515
Now there's a good sign.

01:34:05.515 --> 01:34:06.641
Now there's a good sign.

01:34:09.519 --> 01:34:10.353
Man.

01:34:10.478 --> 01:34:10.812
Tough crowd.

01:34:10.812 --> 01:34:11.146
Tough crowd.

01:34:11.146 --> 01:34:11.479
Tough crowd.

01:34:11.479 --> 01:34:12.689
Tough crowd.

01:34:15.441 --> 01:34:15.775
Suzume, cats don't follow people without a reason.

01:34:15.775 --> 01:34:16.109
Suzume, cats don't follow people without a reason.

01:34:16.109 --> 01:34:16.442

01:34:17.443 --> 01:34:17.777
Suzume, cats don't follow people without a reason.

01:34:17.777 --> 01:34:18.111
Suzume, cats don't follow people without a reason.

01:34:18.111 --> 01:34:19.362
Suzume, cats don't follow people without a reason.

01:34:19.654 --> 01:34:19.988
Unlike dogs.

01:34:19.988 --> 01:34:21.239
Unlike dogs.

01:34:22.031 --> 01:34:22.365
Those black and white cats...

01:34:22.365 --> 01:34:23.449
Those black and white cats...

01:34:23.867 --> 01:34:24.200
must really want something from you.

01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:24.534
must really want something from you.

01:34:24.534 --> 01:34:24.868
must really want something from you.

01:34:24.868 --> 01:34:25.201
must really want something from you.

01:34:25.201 --> 01:34:25.535
must really want something from you.

01:34:25.535 --> 01:34:26.870
must really want something from you.

01:34:26.995 --> 01:34:28.121
Precisely.

01:34:28.246 --> 01:34:28.955
Wha—1?

01:34:29.289 --> 01:34:29.622
Return everything as it was, with human hands.

01:34:29.622 --> 01:34:29.956
Return everything as it was, with human hands.

01:34:29.956 --> 01:34:30.290

Return everything as it was, with human hands.

01:34:34.836 --> 01:34:35.962
It spoke!

01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:39.174
Ah...hey, hey, he—

01:34:39.174 --> 01:34:39.507
Ah...hey, hey, he—

01:34:39.507 --> 01:34:39.841

Ah...hey, hey, he—

01:34:40.175 --> 01:34:41.384
Ah...hey, hey, he—

01:34:42.260 --> 01:34:42.594
You're kidding me...

01:34:42.594 --> 01:34:43.678
You're kidding me...

01:34:55.023 --> 01:34:55.356
Hey, it's fixed.

01:34:55.356 --> 01:34:56.524
Hey, it's fixed.

01:35:00.820 --> 01:35:01.988
Oh, come on!

01:35:02.739 --> 01:35:03.072
That could've ended much worse.

01:35:03.072 --> 01:35:03.406
That could've ended much worse.

01:35:03.406 --> 01:35:04.490
That could've ended much worse.

01:35:04.866 --> 01:35:05.200
Never mind that. Did those cats just talk?

01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:05.533
Never mind that. Did those cats just talk?

01:35:05.533 --> 01:35:05.867

01:35:06.534 --> 01:35:06.868
Never mind that. Did those cats just talk?

01:35:06.868 --> 01:35:08.077
Never mind that. Did those cats just talk?

01:35:08.203 --> 01:35:08.536
T-They totally did, didn't they?

01:35:08.536 --> 01:35:08.870
T-They totally did, didn't they?

01:35:08.870 --> 01:35:09.204

T-They totally did, didn't they?

01:35:11.748 --> 01:35:12.582
What the heck was that?

01:35:12.707 --> 01:35:13.499
Supernatural stuff?

01:35:13.625 --> 01:35:13.958
Nah, that can't be possible.

01:35:13.958 --> 01:35:15.251
Nah, that can't be possible.

01:35:15.376 --> 01:35:15.710
Excuse me!

01:35:15.710 --> 01:35:16.794
Excuse me!

01:35:17.503 --> 01:35:18.713
They won't stop.

01:35:20.215 --> 01:35:21.299
Serizawa!

01:35:21.424 --> 01:35:21.758
We're about 10km out, right?

01:35:21.758 --> 01:35:22.091
We're about 10km out, right?

01:35:22.091 --> 01:35:23.259
We're about 10km out, right?

01:35:23.635 --> 01:35:23.968

[Approximately 20km to your destination. ]

01:35:26.596 --> 01:35:26.930
More like 20.

01:35:26.930 --> 01:35:28.097
More like 20.

01:35:28.223 --> 01:35:29.432
It's still quite a ways away.

01:35:31.726 --> 01:35:33.019
I'm gonna run the rest.

01:35:33.937 --> 01:35:34.270

01:36:31.411 --> 01:36:32.495
I give up.

01:36:33.997 --> 01:36:34.330

Hey, Suzume...

01:36:46.134 --> 01:36:46.467
Who are these guys?

01:36:46.467 --> 01:36:47.719
Who are these guys?

01:36:47.844 --> 01:36:48.177
They're supposed to be gods?

01:36:48.177 --> 01:36:49.387
They're supposed to be gods?

01:36:49.595 --> 01:36:50.680
Gods!?

01:36:54.559 --> 01:36:54.892
What I said, in the parking lot...

01:36:54.892 --> 01:36:55.226

What I said, in the parking lot...

01:36:58.062 --> 01:36:58.396
Sure, I've felt that way at times...

01:36:58.396 --> 01:36:58.730

Sure, I've felt that way at times...

01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:00.773
But that's not the only thing I've felt.

01:37:00.773 --> 01:37:01.107
But that's not the only thing I've felt.

01:37:01.107 --> 01:37:01.441
But that's not the only thing I've felt.

But that's not the only thing I've felt.

01:37:02.984 --> 01:37:03.651
Yeah.

01:37:04.277 --> 01:37:04.610
You understand it's not the only thing...

01:37:04.610 --> 01:37:04.944
You understand it's not the only thing...

01:37:04.944 --> 01:37:05.278

Me too.

01:37:10.742 --> 01:37:11.075
I'm sorry, Tamaki.

01:37:11.075 --> 01:37:12.410

01:47:57.137 --> 01:47:57.471
I know that life is fleeting.

01:47:57.471 --> 01:47:57.805
I know that life is fleeting.

01:47:57.805 --> 01:47:58.138

01:47:58.806 --> 01:47:59.848
I know that life is fleeting.

01:48:00.307 --> 01:48:00.641
We live side-by-side with death.

01:48:00.641 --> 01:48:00.975
We live side-by-side with death.

01:48:00.975 --> 01:48:01.308

We live side-by-side with death.

01:48:04.103 --> 01:48:04.436
Even then...

01:48:04.436 --> 01:48:05.604
Even then...

01:48:05.938 --> 01:48:06.271
once more...

01:48:06.271 --> 01:48:07.356
once more...

01:48:07.564 --> 01:48:07.898

01:48:08.232 --> 01:48:09.358
even for just one moment more

01:48:09.775 --> 01:48:10.109
we wish to live!

01:48:10.109 --> 01:48:10.442
we wish to live!

01:48:10.442 --> 01:48:11.610
we wish to live!

01:48:12.653 --> 01:48:12.987
Divine gods...!

01:48:12.987 --> 01:48:14.321
Divine gods...!

01:48:14.822 --> 01:48:15.155

I beg of you!

01:48:17.491 --> 01:48:18.617
I beg of you!

01:48:25.040 --> 01:48:25.916
It's okay.

01:48:26.041 --> 01:48:27.167
Entrust yourself.

01:48:49.314 --> 01:48:50.524
I return them to you!!

01:49:38.405 --> 01:49:38.739
Suzume...

01:49:38.739 --> 01:49:39.782
Suzume...

01:49:57.966 --> 01:49:58.300
Suzume, there's someone here...

01:49:58.300 --> 01:49:58.634

Suzume, there's someone here...

01:50:01.178 --> 01:50:02.096
A child?

01:50:03.138 --> 01:50:04.098
That girl...

01:50:04.389 --> 01:50:04.723
I...need to go!

01:50:04.723 --> 01:50:05.057

Suzume?

01:50:17.820 --> 01:50:18.904
I see...

01:50:19.738 --> 01:50:20.072
That's right.

01:50:20.072 --> 01:50:21.323
That's right.

01:50:22.825 --> 01:50:23.158
I finally understand!

01:50:23.158 --> 01:50:23.492

Suzume.

01:50:36.088 --> 01:50:37.297
Suzume!

01:50:42.928 --> 01:50:43.887
Mommy?

01:50:46.473 --> 01:50:47.641
No...

01:50:49.309 --> 01:50:49.643
Do you know where my mommy is?

01:50:49.643 --> 01:50:49.977

01:50:53.730 --> 01:50:54.064
And she must be super worried!

01:50:54.064 --> 01:50:55.399
And she must be super worried!

01:50:55.649 --> 01:50:55.983
I need to go to where she is!

01:50:55.983 --> 01:50:56.316
I need to go to where she is!

01:50:56.316 --> 01:50:56.650

01:50:58.026 --> 01:50:59.194
Suzume, you're...

01:50:59.319 --> 01:50:59.653

Suzume—!

01:51:07.661 --> 01:51:08.912
And my house is...

01:51:09.246 --> 01:51:09.580
It's gone, so...

01:51:09.580 --> 01:51:09.913
It's gone, so...

01:51:09.913 --> 01:51:10.247

01:51:10.247 --> 01:51:11.540
It's gone, so...

01:51:12.374 --> 01:51:13.709
Mommy...

01:51:14.668 --> 01:51:15.002
She just doesn't know where to look for me, so...!

01:51:15.002 --> 01:51:15.335

01:51:18.422 --> 01:51:18.755
That's enough!!

01:51:18.755 --> 01:51:20.048
That's enough!!

01:51:22.092 --> 01:51:22.426
Deep down, I already knew...

01:51:22.426 --> 01:51:22.759
Deep down, I already knew...

01:51:22.759 --> 01:51:23.093

01:51:26.346 --> 01:51:27.181
Why?

01:51:27.306 --> 01:51:27.639
Mommy's still out there! She's looking for me!

01:51:27.639 --> 01:51:27.973

What am I supposed to do?

01:51:46.909 --> 01:51:47.242
What am I supposed to do?

01:51:47.242 --> 01:51:48.493
