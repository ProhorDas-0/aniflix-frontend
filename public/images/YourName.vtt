00:00:53.208 --> 00:00:57.656
Once in a while when I wake up

00:00:57.875 --> 00:01:01.413
I find myself crying.

00:01:01.625 --> 00:01:05.664
I can never recall
the dream I must have had.

00:01:05.875 --> 00:01:07.285
But...

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.500
But...

00:01:08.667 --> 00:01:11.704
The sensation that I've lost something

00:01:11.917 --> 00:01:15.080
lingers for a long time after I wake up.

00:01:23.292 --> 00:01:25.374
I'm always searching

00:01:25.583 --> 00:01:28.040
for something, for someone.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.620
This feeling has possessed me,
I think, from that day...

00:01:34.417 --> 00:01:37.955
That day when the stars came falling.

00:01:38.167 --> 00:01:39.498
It was almost as if...

00:01:39.708 --> 00:01:42.780
As if it were a scene from a dream.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.742
Nothing more, nothing less

00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:48.370
than a beautiful view.
Than a beautiful view.

00:01:48.708 --> 00:01:53.907
How I wish our words travel

00:01:54.125 --> 00:01:59.495
till the edge of the world

00:01:59.708 --> 00:02:04.372
without vanishing

00:02:04.583 --> 00:02:10.158
then what will those words be?

00:02:10.375 --> 00:02:17.201
To make promises that won't fade
let's say it on the count of three

00:02:27.458 --> 00:02:30.416
"Your wish may come true
to some degrees”

00:02:30.625 --> 00:02:35.198
I no longer cannot see
the eyes of this saying

00:02:35.417 --> 00:02:37.999
since when and why? I don't know

00:02:38.208 --> 00:02:43.828
where the point rain starts and ends,
where the rainbow begins and ends

00:02:44.042 --> 00:02:45.998
place where my life fades,

00:02:46.208 --> 00:02:50.030
I've always believed that there is
something I've been chasing

00:02:54.417 --> 00:02:59.411
one day we'll go
where all living creatures have never been,

00:02:59.625 --> 00:03:04.164
unprecedented, unexplored sentiments
give them five and kiss your time away

00:03:04.375 --> 00:03:10.075
5th dimension teases me
but I still see you

00:03:10.292 --> 00:03:15.662
let's make our signal
how to say "nice to meet you"

00:03:15.875 --> 00:03:19.322
and I chase your name

00:03:45.417 --> 00:03:49.365
Taki. Taki.

00:03:50.292 --> 00:03:52.578
Don't you remember me?

00:03:54.667 --> 00:03:56.407
My name is...

00:03:57.708 --> 00:03:59.244
Mitsuha!

00:04:34.917 --> 00:04:36.953
Mitsuha, what are you doing?

00:04:37.167 --> 00:04:41.456
Well, it feels incredibly realistic...

00:04:41.667 --> 00:04:43.532
What? "Mitsuha"?

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.822
Are you half-asleep? Breakfast!

00:04:47.042 --> 00:04:48.532
Hurry up!

00:05:08.083 --> 00:05:10.574
What? What?

00:05:19.667 --> 00:05:21.908
Do you want last night's leftovers?

00:05:22.125 --> 00:05:23.831
You can have them.

00:05:24.042 --> 00:05:25.703
Good morning. Good morning.

00:05:25.917 --> 00:05:27.373
Mitsuha, you're late!

00:05:27.583 --> 00:05:30.074
I'll make breakfast tomorrow.

00:05:35.458 --> 00:05:36.743
Is this too much?

00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.368
Oh, well.

00:05:38.583 --> 00:05:40.494
You're normal today.

00:05:40.708 --> 00:05:42.414
You were nuts yesterday.

00:05:42.625 --> 00:05:45.207
What are you talking about?

00:05:46.583 --> 00:05:50.451
Good morning, everyone.

00:05:50.667 --> 00:05:55.286
This is an announcement
from ltomori town hall.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.333
Regarding the mayoral election

00:05:58.542 --> 00:06:03.411
to be held on the 20th next month,
the election committee...

00:06:06.083 --> 00:06:06.538
"Comet to pass by in a month:
Visible to the naked eye"

00:06:06.542 --> 00:06:12.082
"comet to pass by in a month: Visible to the naked eye" a comet
with an orbital period of 1,200 years will pass by in a month.

00:06:12.083 --> 00:06:12.242
A comet with an orbital period
of 1,200 years will pass by in a month.

00:06:12.458 --> 00:06:16.406
The comet will be visible
to the naked eye for several days...

00:06:16.625 --> 00:06:18.490
Just make it up with him.

00:06:18.708 --> 00:06:19.993
It's an adult matter.

00:06:20.083 --> 00:06:20.196
"Position of comet tiamat"

00:06:20.208 --> 00:06:23.496
ee

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:23.704
Jaxa is preparing to observe
the celestial show of the century.

00:06:23.708 --> 00:06:24.572
Jaxa is preparing to observe
the celestial show of the century.

00:06:24.583 --> 00:06:27.183
Jaxa is preparing to observe
the celestial show of the century.

00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.789
We're going now!
We're going now!

00:07:02.917 --> 00:07:05.124
Study hard!

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:11.490
Mitsuha!

00:07:11.708 --> 00:07:13.539
Morning, Sayaka, Tessie.

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:14.489
Morning.

00:07:14.708 --> 00:07:17.450
Get off. Why? Meanie.

00:07:17.667 --> 00:07:19.248
You're heavy. That's rude.

00:07:19.458 --> 00:07:21.289
You two get along so well.

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.491
We do not! We do not!

00:07:25.583 --> 00:07:27.869
Your hair looks all right today.

00:07:28.083 --> 00:07:29.083
What?

00:07:29.292 --> 00:07:32.079
Yeah, did your grandma exorcise you?

00:07:32.292 --> 00:07:34.999
Exorcise?
You were totally possessed!

00:07:35.208 --> 00:07:40.373
Cut out the occult stuff.
Mitsuha is just stressed. Right?

00:07:40.583 --> 00:07:43.120
Huh? What are you talking about?

00:07:43.333 --> 00:07:45.119
You don't remember?

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:47.865
And above all,

00:07:48.083 --> 00:07:53.453
restoring the town's fiscal health
to continue its revitalization project!

00:07:53.667 --> 00:07:55.373
Only when these are achieved

00:07:55.583 --> 00:07:59.280
can a safe and secure
community be created!

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.582
As the incumbent mayor...

00:08:01.792 --> 00:08:04.374
He'll just be reelected again anyway.

00:08:04.583 --> 00:08:07.495
I heard he's been dishing out the pork.

00:08:07.708 --> 00:08:09.073
Hey, miyamizu.

00:08:09.292 --> 00:08:10.748
Morning.

00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:14.325
So the mayor's kid and
his contractor's kid get along, too.

00:08:14.542 --> 00:08:15.952
Ew.

00:08:20.042 --> 00:08:21.998
Mitsuha!

00:08:22.208 --> 00:08:24.995
Stand up straight!

00:08:25.208 --> 00:08:28.200
He's strict with his family.
I'm impressed.

00:08:28.417 --> 00:08:31.284
So embarrassing.
Sucks to be her.

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:33.206
Mitsuha.

00:08:34.042 --> 00:08:36.328
In front of everybody...

00:08:39.417 --> 00:08:40.657
"Who are you?"

00:08:48.167 --> 00:08:49.657
"Tasokare"

00:08:49.667 --> 00:08:50.656
"tasokare" "tasokare" means "who is that" and
is the origin of the word "tasogare-doki."

00:08:50.667 --> 00:08:55.912
"Tasokare" means "who is that" and is
the origin of the word "tasogare-doki."

00:08:56.125 --> 00:08:59.617
Twilight, when it's neither day nor night.

00:08:59.833 --> 00:09:05.578
When the world blurs and one might
encounter something not human.

00:09:05.792 --> 00:09:10.081
Older expressions include " karetaso-doki"

00:09:10.167 --> 00:09:10.326
"karetaso/kawatare = who is that?"

00:09:10.333 --> 00:09:13.120
"Karetaso/kawatare = who is that?"
And "kawatare-doki."

00:09:13.125 --> 00:09:13.329
"Karetaso/kawatare = who is that?"

00:09:13.333 --> 00:09:15.540
"Karetaso/kawatare = who is that?"
Question! Not "kataware-doki"?

00:09:15.542 --> 00:09:15.655
"Karetaso/kawatare = who is that?"

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:19.572
Kataware-doki?
I think that's a local dialect.

00:09:19.792 --> 00:09:21.828
I've heard that itomori's elderly
still use classical language.

00:09:21.833 --> 00:09:23.243
I've heard that itomori's elderly
still use classical language.

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:23.454
"Who are you?"

00:09:23.458 --> 00:09:25.414
Eee lsees toor en ee res

00:09:25.417 --> 00:09:26.657
"who are you?"

00:09:27.875 --> 00:09:29.831
Okay, next: Mitsuha.

00:09:30.042 --> 00:09:31.578
Yes!

00:09:32.208 --> 00:09:35.496
Oh, so you remember your name today.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.911
You don't remember?

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:45.618
Yesterday you forgot
where your desk and locker were.

00:09:45.833 --> 00:09:49.325
You had bedhead and no ribbon.

00:09:51.417 --> 00:09:53.658
What? No way! Really?

00:09:53.875 --> 00:09:56.161
It was like you had amnesia.

00:09:56.375 --> 00:10:00.948
Well, I do feel like I've been
in a strange dream lately...

00:10:01.167 --> 00:10:04.204
A dream about someone else's life?

00:10:04.417 --> 00:10:07.329
I can't remember clearly.

00:10:07.542 --> 00:10:09.828
I know! That was...

00:10:10.042 --> 00:10:11.157
Your previous life!

00:10:11.375 --> 00:10:15.368
Or maybe your subconscious
linked to the Everett multiverse...

00:10:15.583 --> 00:10:16.583
Stay out of this.

00:10:16.792 --> 00:10:20.705
Oh! Tessie, did you
write that in my notebook?

00:10:22.125 --> 00:10:24.411
Nothing.

00:10:24.625 --> 00:10:28.117
But mitsuha, you really were
a bit weird yesterday.

00:10:28.333 --> 00:10:30.915
You been feeling all right?

00:10:31.542 --> 00:10:34.659
That's so strange. I feel fine.

00:10:34.875 --> 00:10:38.538
Maybe it's stress.
That ritual is coming up, isn't it?

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:41.162
Oh, don't remind me!

00:10:41.375 --> 00:10:44.162
I can't stand this town anymore.

00:10:44.375 --> 00:10:49.790
It's too small and close-knit.
I want to graduate and go to Tokyo.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.199
I don't blame you.
There's really nothing in this town.

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:58.536
Trains come every two hours.

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:00.581
The store closes at 9 P.M.

00:11:00.792 --> 00:11:02.578
No bookstore. No dentist.

00:11:02.792 --> 00:11:02.826
But two pubs for some reason.

00:11:02.833 --> 00:11:05.165
But two pubs for some reason.

00:11:05.167 --> 00:11:05.280
"Mother's" "cat's eye pub"

00:11:05.375 --> 00:11:06.160
no jobs.

00:11:06.375 --> 00:11:07.410
No brides.

00:11:07.625 --> 00:11:10.332
Short sunlight hours.

00:11:11.583 --> 00:11:14.325
Give me a break! What?

00:11:15.167 --> 00:11:17.579
I mean... how about we stop by a café?

00:11:17.792 --> 00:11:19.157
A café? Really?

00:11:19.375 --> 00:11:20.990
Where? Where?

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:25.750
Hello.

00:11:25.917 --> 00:11:27.953
Hello.

00:11:32.375 --> 00:11:33.785
This is a café?

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.991
You knew there wasn't one.

00:11:36.208 --> 00:11:39.655
Mitsuha just went home.

00:11:39.875 --> 00:11:42.036
Things must be rough for her.

00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:44.536
Well, she takes center stage.

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:46.411
Yeah.

00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.368
Hey, Tessie.

00:11:50.583 --> 00:11:52.073
What?

00:11:52.292 --> 00:11:54.999
What will you do after you graduate?

00:11:55.208 --> 00:11:58.496
What's this? You asking about my future?

00:11:59.792 --> 00:12:05.082
Nothing special. I'll probably keep on
living a normal life in this town.

00:12:20.917 --> 00:12:23.078
I'd rather do that, too.

00:12:23.292 --> 00:12:25.783
You're not ready yet, yotsuha.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.207
Listen to the thread's voice.

00:12:28.417 --> 00:12:31.409
When you keep spooling like that,

00:12:31.625 --> 00:12:35.789
emotions will eventually start flowing
between you and the thread.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.410
Threads don't talk.

00:12:37.625 --> 00:12:39.536
She means, "concentrate."

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:45.495
1,000 years of itomori's history
is etched into our braided cords.

00:12:45.708 --> 00:12:49.451
Listen. 200 years ago...

00:12:49.667 --> 00:12:51.032
Here she goes again.

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:58.156
Sandal maker mayugoro's bathroom caught
on fire and burned down this whole area.

00:12:58.375 --> 00:13:01.492
The shrine and
old documents were destroyed

00:13:01.708 --> 00:13:02.948
and this is known as...

00:13:03.167 --> 00:13:05.158
The great fire of mayugoro.

00:13:05.375 --> 00:13:09.869
The fire has his name? Poor mayugoro.

00:13:10.083 --> 00:13:16.739
So we lost the meaning of our festivals,
and only the form lived on.

00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:20.576
But even if words are lost,
tradition should be handed down.

00:13:20.792 --> 00:13:25.616
That's the important task
we at miyamizu shrine have.

00:13:28.167 --> 00:13:32.160
But that foolish son-in-law...

00:13:33.167 --> 00:13:37.285
As if leaving shinto priesthood
and this house weren't enough,

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:40.162
now politics? He's hopeless.

00:13:40.375 --> 00:13:43.082
Have another, my man.

00:13:45.875 --> 00:13:47.831
I'm counting on your help again.

00:13:48.042 --> 00:13:49.532
Leave it to me.

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:53.163
You'll get votes from the kadoiri
and sakagami districts.

00:13:53.375 --> 00:13:54.615
How's it going with her?

00:13:54.833 --> 00:13:56.744
It's not that easy.

00:13:58.458 --> 00:14:00.449
I smell corruption.

00:14:00.667 --> 00:14:02.578
Don't be ridiculous.

00:14:02.792 --> 00:14:04.953
Bring us a few more hot saké.

00:14:05.167 --> 00:14:06.202
Okay.

00:14:06.417 --> 00:14:08.874
Katsuhiko, work on site this weekend.

00:14:09.083 --> 00:14:11.540
Learn how to use explosives.

00:14:12.458 --> 00:14:13.458
Can't hear you.

00:14:13.625 --> 00:14:15.035
Yes!

00:14:28.083 --> 00:14:31.280
We both have it rough, don't we?

00:14:49.125 --> 00:14:51.912
Is that yotsuha? She's all grown up.

00:14:52.125 --> 00:14:54.912
They're both pretty like their mother.

00:14:56.583 --> 00:14:57.823
Hey.

00:14:58.042 --> 00:14:59.452
Hey.

00:15:31.167 --> 00:15:34.079
It's the oldest saké in the world.

00:15:34.292 --> 00:15:39.491
By chewing on rice, spitting it out,
and letting it ferment, it becomes alcohol.

00:15:39.708 --> 00:15:44.577
"Kuchikamizake." do the gods
appreciate saké made that way?

00:15:44.792 --> 00:15:46.783
Of course they do.

00:15:48.667 --> 00:15:51.409
Hey, look. It's miyamizu.

00:15:56.583 --> 00:15:58.699
Oh! I could never do that!

00:15:58.917 --> 00:16:00.373
Isn't she embarrassed?

00:16:00.583 --> 00:16:02.790
I can't believe it.

00:16:16.542 --> 00:16:21.582
Cheer up, mitsuha. Who cares
if a few classmates saw you?

00:16:21.792 --> 00:16:24.864
I envy your prepubescent lack of concern.

00:16:25.083 --> 00:16:29.747
Why not sell lots of kuchikamizake
and use the money to go to Tokyo?

00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:32.290
Where do you get such ideas?

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:38.075
Sell them with photos and making-of videos.
Name it "shrine maiden's saké."

00:16:38.292 --> 00:16:39.907
You'll make money!

00:16:40.917 --> 00:16:42.908
"Shrine maiden's saké"

00:16:43.208 --> 00:16:45.870
no. That breaks the liquor tax law.

00:16:47.417 --> 00:16:49.248
That's the problem?

00:16:55.125 --> 00:16:59.869
I hate this town! I hate this life!

00:17:00.083 --> 00:17:04.531
Please make me a handsome
Tokyo boy in my next life!

00:17:08.625 --> 00:17:10.832
What a fool...

00:17:38.417 --> 00:17:39.827
Ow!

00:17:42.167 --> 00:17:44.032
Ouch...

00:17:52.792 --> 00:17:54.202
Where...

00:18:05.333 --> 00:18:08.040
Something's there...

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:22.500
Ow!

00:18:22.625 --> 00:18:25.082
Taki! Are you up?

00:18:26.667 --> 00:18:29.830
It was your turn to cook. Wake up on time.

00:18:30.042 --> 00:18:32.624
I'm sorry.

00:18:32.833 --> 00:18:36.280
I'm going now. Finish up the miso soup.

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:37.615
Okay.

00:18:37.833 --> 00:18:41.280
Go to school even if you're late. See you.

00:18:42.375 --> 00:18:44.115
Have a nice day.

00:18:55.042 --> 00:18:56.578
What a strange dream.

00:18:58.208 --> 00:19:01.245
"From tsukasa: Run, you're late!"

00:19:01.958 --> 00:19:06.497
What? Who's it from? Tsukasa? Who's that?

00:19:16.125 --> 00:19:17.911
I have to use the bathroom.

00:19:26.792 --> 00:19:28.783
This is too realistic.

00:20:18.958 --> 00:20:20.949
"Shinjuku station"

00:20:39.542 --> 00:20:41.999
I'm in Tokyo!

00:20:44.458 --> 00:20:48.451
"Jingu high school"

00:20:48.625 --> 00:20:50.365
where'd you get it? Daikanyama.

00:20:50.583 --> 00:20:52.289
The opening act at the next gig...

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:54.786
Let's skip club and go to a movie.

00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:01.660
Taki!

00:21:03.042 --> 00:21:07.081
Arriving at noon, huh? Let's eat lunch.

00:21:07.292 --> 00:21:08.623
You ignored my text.

00:21:08.833 --> 00:21:10.494
Oh, tsukasa?

00:21:10.708 --> 00:21:13.871
At least you sound apologetic.

00:21:15.333 --> 00:21:17.540
You got lost? Yeah.

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:21.197
How could you get lost
on the way to school?

00:21:21.417 --> 00:21:24.864
Uh... well... I...
Feminine pronouns?

00:21:25.083 --> 00:21:26.914
I!

00:21:27.125 --> 00:21:28.661
I?

00:21:28.875 --> 00:21:30.285
I?

00:21:32.083 --> 00:21:38.033
I was enjoying myself.
It's so festive and all in Tokyo.

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:40.536
You seem to have an accent.

00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:42.615
Where's your lunch?

00:21:42.833 --> 00:21:45.324
Geez. Are you half-asleep?

00:21:45.542 --> 00:21:49.080
You got something?
Croquette-egg sandwich sounds good!

00:21:52.958 --> 00:21:54.698
Thank you.

00:21:56.333 --> 00:21:57.693
Let's go to the café after school.

00:21:57.750 --> 00:22:00.207
Oh, that one? Okay. Coming, taki?

00:22:00.417 --> 00:22:03.250
What? What? What?

00:22:03.458 --> 00:22:04.994
A café?

00:22:08.167 --> 00:22:09.748
Nice timberwork up there.

00:22:09.958 --> 00:22:12.165
Yeah, attention to detail.

00:22:12.375 --> 00:22:14.536
Taki, have you decided?

00:22:15.042 --> 00:22:19.490
What? I could live for a month
for the price of these!

00:22:19.708 --> 00:22:22.120
What era are you from again?

00:22:22.333 --> 00:22:26.576
Hmm. Oh, well. It is a dream.

00:22:32.625 --> 00:22:34.456
What a great dream.

00:22:39.875 --> 00:22:43.288
Oh no, what should I do? I'm late for work!

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:45.240
Your shift is today?

00:22:45.458 --> 00:22:48.530
Go, then. Oh, yeah.

00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:51.947
Oh! Um...

00:22:52.167 --> 00:22:54.658
Where do I work?

00:22:54.875 --> 00:22:56.706
What? What?

00:23:02.458 --> 00:23:04.744
Tables 6, 7, and 10 are waiting!

00:23:04.958 --> 00:23:07.244
Table 12! Taki!

00:23:07.958 --> 00:23:09.289
Here you go.

00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:12.287
Uh, zucchini and tomato salad...

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:13.910
We didn't order that.

00:23:14.125 --> 00:23:16.537
Taki, I said we're out of truffles!

00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:18.456
Taki, can't hear youl!

00:23:18.667 --> 00:23:20.077
Taki!

00:23:21.125 --> 00:23:23.958
When is this dream going to end?

00:23:31.917 --> 00:23:33.908
Hey. Hey, waiter.

00:23:34.125 --> 00:23:35.865
Oh, yes?

00:23:37.583 --> 00:23:40.950
There was a toothpick in our pizza.

00:23:41.167 --> 00:23:44.079
We could have gotten hurt.

00:23:44.292 --> 00:23:48.786
Good thing I noticed.
What do you have to say?

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.161
Uh, well...

00:23:51.375 --> 00:23:56.995
But... there are no toothpicks
in an Italian restaurant's...

00:23:57.208 --> 00:23:58.789
Excuse me.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.707
Is everything okay?

00:24:01.917 --> 00:24:03.327
I'll handle this.

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:07.537
What's wrong with you today?

00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:10.947
Please accept our apologies.
Your meal is on the house.

00:24:11.167 --> 00:24:12.167
Oh, really?

00:24:12.333 --> 00:24:14.915
I hope you weren't hurt.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.035
Um...

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:27.250
Okudera...

00:24:27.417 --> 00:24:29.123
Ms. okudera.

00:24:29.333 --> 00:24:31.289
Ms. okudera. Thank you...

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:32.831
A stroke of bad luck today.

00:24:33.042 --> 00:24:34.042
No, uh...

00:24:34.167 --> 00:24:36.078
Bet it was a set-up.

00:24:36.292 --> 00:24:39.739
Handled it according to the manual, but...

00:24:39.958 --> 00:24:43.997
Oh, Ms. okudera, your skirt!

00:24:44.208 --> 00:24:45.208
You okay?

00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:47.707
What happened? Slashed.

00:24:47.917 --> 00:24:49.327
That dick from earlier?

00:24:49.542 --> 00:24:51.624
What now? Do you remember his face?

00:24:51.833 --> 00:24:53.164
No.

00:24:53.375 --> 00:24:55.161
Come with me.

00:24:55.375 --> 00:24:57.491
Hey, taki!

00:24:57.708 --> 00:24:59.369
Take off your skirt.

00:24:59.583 --> 00:25:02.245
Oh! I'll look the other way!

00:25:06.208 --> 00:25:08.244
This won't take long.

00:25:12.417 --> 00:25:14.954
Done!

00:25:15.167 --> 00:25:19.080
Wow, taki! It looks better than before!

00:25:20.417 --> 00:25:23.864
Thank you for saving me today.

00:25:25.542 --> 00:25:29.114
Actually, I was concerned about you.

00:25:29.333 --> 00:25:33.121
You're weak but quick-tempered.

00:25:33.333 --> 00:25:35.540
I like you better today.

00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:39.413
Never knew you had a feminine side.

00:25:40.458 --> 00:25:42.449
"Jr yamanote line: 7 min."

00:25:49.875 --> 00:25:53.572
What a realistic dream,
if I do say so myself.

00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:00.242
Oh, he keeps a diary.

00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:06.536
He's so organized.

00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:09.332
Wish I lived in Tokyo, too.

00:26:11.958 --> 00:26:14.620
Oh! That's her!

00:26:19.333 --> 00:26:21.540
A crush, maybe?

00:26:26.958 --> 00:26:32.954
"Walked to the station with Ms. okudera
after work, thanks to my feminine powers!"

00:26:34.542 --> 00:26:35.782
"Who are you?"

00:26:45.208 --> 00:26:49.281
"Mitsuha"

00:27:04.708 --> 00:27:06.289
What is this?

00:27:06.708 --> 00:27:07.788

00:27:13.292 --> 00:27:13.326
"Thanks to my feminine powers!"

00:27:13.333 --> 00:27:15.244
"Thanks to my feminine powers!"

00:27:15.250 --> 00:27:16.490
"Thanks to my feminine powers!"

00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:17.956
Let's hit a café again today.

00:27:18.167 --> 00:27:20.533
Sorry, I have to go to work.

00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:22.741
Do you remember where to go?

00:27:24.833 --> 00:27:28.906
Tsukasa, was it you who pranked my phone?

00:27:29.125 --> 00:27:33.038
Oh, never mind. See you.

00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:35.741
He's acting normal today.

00:27:35.958 --> 00:27:38.449
Yesterday he was kind of cute.

00:27:38.667 --> 00:27:40.077
What?

00:27:42.292 --> 00:27:44.203
Wha... what?

00:27:44.417 --> 00:27:46.624
Taki, you tried to outdo us!

00:27:46.833 --> 00:27:48.915
You walked home with her!

00:27:51.250 --> 00:27:53.662
Did I really? With Ms. okudera?

00:27:53.875 --> 00:27:55.706
What happened afterwards?

00:27:56.833 --> 00:27:58.664
I don't really remember.

00:27:58.875 --> 00:28:00.740
Oh, really, now?

00:28:00.958 --> 00:28:03.540
Okudera, coming through!

00:28:04.333 --> 00:28:06.494
Hi, guys. Hello.

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:09.331
Let's make this a good one.

00:28:09.542 --> 00:28:11.578
Right, taki?

00:28:21.208 --> 00:28:24.700
"Mitsuha? Who are you? What are you?"

00:28:28.208 --> 00:28:30.950
Breakfast is ready! Hurry up!

00:28:33.917 --> 00:28:35.578
Boobs?

00:28:37.458 --> 00:28:39.198
Morning.

00:28:44.875 --> 00:28:47.537
Why is everyone staring at me?

00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:50.947
Well, you made quite a scene yesterday.

00:28:51.167 --> 00:28:52.577
Huh?

00:28:53.458 --> 00:28:54.458
"Still-life drawing"

00:28:55.458 --> 00:28:56.197
did you see the election posters?

00:28:56.417 --> 00:28:59.614
Doesn't matter who wins. It's all about
how to serve up the grants.

00:28:59.833 --> 00:29:02.996
Shh! Someone's livelihood depends on it.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.207
They mean me, right?

00:29:06.417 --> 00:29:08.703
Well, yeah.

00:29:08.917 --> 00:29:10.578
Hey, mitsuhal!

00:29:20.083 --> 00:29:25.453
Wha...? Wha...? I did what?

00:29:27.542 --> 00:29:29.032
Mitsuha?

00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:35.956
"What is this life?!"

Could it be that we're really...

00:29:43.667 --> 00:29:46.374
In our dreams, that guy and I are...

00:29:46.583 --> 00:29:49.165
In our dreams, that girl and I are...

00:29:49.167 --> 00:29:50.156

In our dreams, that girl and I are...

00:29:50.375 --> 00:29:52.161
Switching places?
Switching places?

00:30:25.875 --> 00:30:29.038
I'm beginning to get what's going on.

00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:32.572
Taki is a boy my age living in Tokyo.

00:30:32.792 --> 00:30:35.534
I switch with mitsuha at random,

00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:38.332
a few times a week, unexpectedly.

00:30:38.542 --> 00:30:39.657
Sleep triggers it. The cause is a mystery.

00:30:39.667 --> 00:30:41.874
"Condition: Sleep? Cause: Unknown"
sleep triggers it. The cause is a mystery.

00:30:41.875 --> 00:30:42.079
"Condition: Sleep? Cause: Unknown"

00:30:42.083 --> 00:30:42.162
"condition: Sleep? Cause: Unknown" my memory
of the switch is hazy after I wake up.

00:30:42.167 --> 00:30:46.957
My memory of the switch
is hazy after I wake up.

00:30:47.167 --> 00:30:50.409
But we're definitely switching places.

00:30:50.625 --> 00:30:54.197
It's obvious from the reactions
of the people around us. So...

00:30:54.417 --> 00:30:55.998
So we laid down some rules
to protect each other's lifestyles.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.117
So we laid down some rules
to protect each other's lifestyles.

00:30:59.125 --> 00:30:59.329
So we laid down some rules
to protect each other's lifestyles.

00:30:59.333 --> 00:30:59.492
"No baths! No looking! No touching!" So we laid
down some rules to protect each other's lifestyles.

00:30:59.500 --> 00:30:59.704
"No baths! No looking! No touching!"

00:30:59.708 --> 00:31:02.165
"No baths! No looking! No touching!" Things to watch
out for during the switch, and a list of "don'ts."

00:31:02.167 --> 00:31:02.371
Things to watch out for during
the switch, and a list of "don'ts."

00:31:02.375 --> 00:31:04.366
Things to watch out for during
the switch, and a list of "don'ts."

00:31:04.375 --> 00:31:04.579
“Don't waste money!
No dialect! Don't be late!"

00:31:04.583 --> 00:31:05.743
Ee te ee ne st pei ss s sees ee ot

00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:08.992
we also agreed to leave reports
in our smartphones.

00:31:09.208 --> 00:31:13.872
To work together to tide over
this mysterious phenomenon.

00:31:14.083 --> 00:31:15.368
But...

00:31:15.583 --> 00:31:17.323
But...

00:31:17.542 --> 00:31:19.828
That girl! That guy!

00:31:34.292 --> 00:31:37.739
Guys are staring! Watch the skirt!
Come on, this is basic!

00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:39.081
Guys are staring! Watch the skirt!
Come on, this is basic!

00:31:39.083 --> 00:31:41.364
Guys are staring! Watch the skirt!
Come on, this is basic!

00:31:42.042 --> 00:31:43.782
Stop wasting my money!

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.992
It's your body eating.
And I'm working, too!

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.000
"Braided cords..."

00:31:48.417 --> 00:31:48.872
Braided cords... I can't do this!

00:31:49.083 --> 00:31:50.789
You work too many shifts!

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.116
It's 'cause you waste money!

00:32:12.958 --> 00:32:17.201
Grabbed coffee with Ms. okudera.
You two have a good thing going!

00:32:17.417 --> 00:32:20.864
Mitsuha, stop changing my relationships!

00:32:21.083 --> 00:32:24.496
Taki, why is a girl in love with me?

00:32:24.708 --> 00:32:27.290
You're more popular when I'm you.

00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:29.900
Don't be so full of yourself!
Not like you have a girlfriend!

00:32:30.208 --> 00:32:30.412
"Don't be so full of yourself!"

00:32:30.417 --> 00:32:30.496
"Don't be so full of yourself!"

00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:31.580
You don't have a boyfriend!

00:32:33.542 --> 00:32:33.621
I'm single because I want to be!
I'm single because I want to be!

00:32:33.625 --> 00:32:35.616
I'm single because I want to be!
I'm single because I want to be!

00:32:35.625 --> 00:32:38.345
I'm single because I want to be!
I'm single because I want to be!

00:32:57.500 --> 00:32:59.616
I shouldn't... for her sake.

00:33:03.250 --> 00:33:05.616
You sure do like your boobs.

00:33:05.833 --> 00:33:08.495
We're going now! Get ready!

00:33:10.875 --> 00:33:15.164
Comet tiamat has been visible
to the naked eye for a few days now.

00:33:15.375 --> 00:33:17.240
When and where can it be seen?

00:33:17.250 --> 00:33:17.614

comet tiamat is moving from
east to west as if to follow the sun.

00:33:23.792 --> 00:33:25.578
So it can be seen above Venus...

00:33:25.792 --> 00:33:27.874
Why the uniform?

00:33:35.542 --> 00:33:40.866
Grandma, why is the vessel
of our shrine's god so far away?

00:33:41.083 --> 00:33:44.371
I don't know, thanks to mayugoro.

00:33:44.583 --> 00:33:45.583
Who's that?

00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:47.786
What? He's famous!

00:33:55.833 --> 00:33:57.949
Here, grandma.

00:34:02.417 --> 00:34:04.829
Whoa, mitsuha.

00:34:15.667 --> 00:34:19.956
Mitsuha, yotsuha, do you know "musubi"?

00:34:20.167 --> 00:34:20.952
Musubi?

00:34:21.167 --> 00:34:26.491
Musubi is the old term
for calling the local guardian deity.

00:34:26.708 --> 00:34:29.996
This word has profound meaning.

00:34:30.208 --> 00:34:35.623
Tying thread is musubi.
Connecting people is musubi.

00:34:35.833 --> 00:34:38.700
The flow of time is musubi.

00:34:38.917 --> 00:34:41.909
These are all the god's power.

00:34:42.125 --> 00:34:44.958
So the braided cords that we make

00:34:45.167 --> 00:34:51.447
are the god's art,
and represent the flow of time itself.

00:34:51.667 --> 00:34:54.249
They converge and take shape.

00:34:54.458 --> 00:34:56.790
They twist, tangle,

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:01.869
sometimes unravel,
break, then connect again.

00:35:02.083 --> 00:35:05.951
Musubi: Knotting. That's time.

00:35:08.917 --> 00:35:09.952
Drink.

00:35:10.167 --> 00:35:11.703
Thank you.

00:35:12.583 --> 00:35:13.914
I want some, too!

00:35:14.125 --> 00:35:16.241
That's also musubi.

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:19.991
Whether it be water, rice, or saké,

00:35:20.208 --> 00:35:25.703
when a person consumes something
and it joins their soul, that's musubi.

00:35:25.917 --> 00:35:28.329
So today's offering

00:35:28.542 --> 00:35:34.242
is an important custom
that connects the god and its people.

00:35:35.708 --> 00:35:37.573
Hey, I see it!

00:35:40.667 --> 00:35:45.491
That's the vessel of miyamizu shrine's god?

00:36:02.375 --> 00:36:05.913
Beyond this point is the "kakuriyo."

00:36:06.125 --> 00:36:08.411
It means the underworld.

00:36:09.167 --> 00:36:10.953
I'm in the underworld!

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.414
In exchange for returning to this world,
you must leave behind

00:36:18.625 --> 00:36:21.162
what is most important to you.

00:36:22.833 --> 00:36:25.415
The kuchikamizake.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.615
The kuchikamizake?

00:36:27.833 --> 00:36:31.530
You'll offer it inside the god's vessel.

00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:36.119
It's half of you.

00:36:36.333 --> 00:36:39.405
Half of mitsuha...

00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:58.991
It's twilight already... "Kataware-doki."

00:36:59.208 --> 00:37:01.415
Kataware-doki?

00:37:11.542 --> 00:37:12.542
Oh, yeah,

00:37:12.708 --> 00:37:14.664
maybe we can see the comet.

00:37:15.708 --> 00:37:17.824
The comet?

00:37:18.042 --> 00:37:19.248
Oh?

00:37:19.458 --> 00:37:21.073
Mitsuha,

00:37:21.292 --> 00:37:25.114
you're dreaming right now, aren't you?

00:37:35.917 --> 00:37:38.909
Tears? Why?

00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:43.241
"I'm almost there. Looking forward to it!"

00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:47.447
Ms. okudera? What's she talking about?

00:37:48.458 --> 00:37:50.574
What did mitsuha do this time?

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.490
A date?

00:38:00.625 --> 00:38:03.913
A date with Ms. okudera tomorrow!

00:38:04.125 --> 00:38:07.617
Meet at 10:30 A.M. at the station!

00:38:07.833 --> 00:38:11.530
Or so I'd planned, but...

00:38:25.250 --> 00:38:26.660
Taki.

00:38:27.917 --> 00:38:29.123
Sorry. Did you wait long?

00:38:29.333 --> 00:38:30.948
Yes. No...

00:38:31.167 --> 00:38:33.249
Um...

00:38:41.458 --> 00:38:42.698
I just got here.

00:38:42.917 --> 00:38:46.614
Good. Let's go.

00:38:46.833 --> 00:38:50.951
He's so lucky. They must
be together right about now...

00:38:54.583 --> 00:38:56.073
Huh?

00:39:02.042 --> 00:39:03.873
Why?

00:39:09.833 --> 00:39:12.199
I wanted to go on this date,

00:39:12.417 --> 00:39:18.162
but if it so happens that you
end up going, you better enjoy it!

00:39:22.125 --> 00:39:28.325
However, I'm sure you've never
gone out on a date before...

00:39:28.542 --> 00:39:30.498
I don't know what to say...

00:39:30.708 --> 00:39:34.951
So below are some links
to help you out, you late bloomer.

00:39:35.167 --> 00:39:36.577
Really?

00:39:36.958 --> 00:39:38.278
"You, too, can get a girlfriend!"

00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:43.493
"Despite social anxiety, I got a girl!
The dos and don'ts of texting"

00:39:43.917 --> 00:39:45.999
she's making fun of me.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:46.159
Eet re ea I

00:39:46.167 --> 00:39:49.989

00:40:14.792 --> 00:40:16.999
Taki...

00:40:17.208 --> 00:40:20.746
You're like a different person today.

00:40:30.625 --> 00:40:36.245
Um, Ms. okudera. Are you hungry?
How about dinner?

00:40:36.458 --> 00:40:38.574
Let's call it a day.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.240
Yes.

00:40:41.458 --> 00:40:45.121
Taki, you... sorry if I'm wrong.

00:40:46.208 --> 00:40:50.952
You used to have
a bit of a crush on me, right?

00:40:51.167 --> 00:40:54.489
But now you like someone else.

00:40:56.625 --> 00:40:57.705
No I don't!

00:40:57.917 --> 00:40:58.917
Really?

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.457
No! That's not true at all.

00:41:01.667 --> 00:41:04.500
I wonder.

00:41:04.708 --> 00:41:08.530
Oh, well. Thanks for today.
See you at work.

00:41:22.667 --> 00:41:28.242
By the time the date is over,
the comet will be visible in the sky.

00:41:31.375 --> 00:41:34.287
What is she saying?

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:40.740
"Mitsuha miyamizu"

00:42:02.417 --> 00:42:05.955
Oh, it's you, Tessie.

00:42:06.167 --> 00:42:11.582
No, I just didn't feel like going,
that's all. I'm fine.

00:42:11.792 --> 00:42:15.455
What? The festival? Well...

00:42:15.667 --> 00:42:21.947
Oh, yeah, the comet. Today's the peak
of its brightness, isn't it?

00:42:22.167 --> 00:42:25.409
Okay, got it. Later, then.

00:42:27.167 --> 00:42:30.330
You just want to see her in a yukata.

00:42:30.542 --> 00:42:32.453
What?! No!

00:42:32.667 --> 00:42:35.033
That didn't even occur to me.

00:42:36.667 --> 00:42:38.658
Hey, she sounded kind of down.

00:42:38.875 --> 00:42:40.706
Maybe you annoyed her.

00:42:40.917 --> 00:42:42.032
Come on!

00:42:42.250 --> 00:42:43.035
Sorry I'm late.

00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:45.115
Here she is! Finally!

00:42:46.333 --> 00:42:50.781
Your... your...
Oh! What happened, mitsuha?

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.207
Your hair!

00:42:53.417 --> 00:42:56.375
Looks kinda funny, huh.

00:43:04.750 --> 00:43:08.163
You think some guy
is the reason? Ditched, maybe?

00:43:08.375 --> 00:43:11.412
Why do guys associate
cutting hair with breakups?

00:43:11.625 --> 00:43:13.661
She said she just felt like it.

00:43:13.875 --> 00:43:17.163
Really? She just felt like
cutting off that much hair?

00:43:17.375 --> 00:43:20.867
Oh! Hey! You can see it!

00:43:38.792 --> 00:43:40.953
Wow!

00:43:59.208 --> 00:44:04.908
The phone you are trying to reach
is out of range or has been turned off...

00:44:07.375 --> 00:44:12.540
“I'll tell her about the disastrous date
the next time we switch,"

00:44:12.750 --> 00:44:15.867
I thought. But...

00:44:16.083 --> 00:44:18.825
For some reason, after that,

00:44:19.042 --> 00:44:23.490
mitsuha and I
never switched places again.

00:44:58.417 --> 00:45:01.409
"Mountains in gifu prefecture"

00:45:12.208 --> 00:45:13.823
"Hida mountains"

00:46:16.083 --> 00:46:21.157
What the... what are you doing here?

00:46:23.417 --> 00:46:26.079
Tsukasa told me and here I am!

00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:35.074
Tsukasa, I asked you to
cover for me at home and at work.

00:46:35.292 --> 00:46:36.702
Takagi will cover your shift.

00:46:36.917 --> 00:46:40.205
Leave it to me! But you owe me a meal!

00:46:40.417 --> 00:46:41.827
This isn't funny.

00:46:42.042 --> 00:46:44.283
We were worried about you. Huh?

00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:47.492
You can't go alone. What if it's a con act?

00:46:47.708 --> 00:46:48.743
A con act?

00:46:48.958 --> 00:46:51.119
You're meeting an online friend, right?

00:46:51.333 --> 00:46:53.540
Well, no, not exactly...

00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:56.617
I think he's using a dating site.
No!

00:46:56.833 --> 00:47:00.405
You've been acting weird lately.
We'll keep an eye on you.

00:47:00.625 --> 00:47:02.911
I'm not a kid!

00:47:04.583 --> 00:47:09.623
The switching stopped.
My calls and texts didn't go through.

00:47:09.833 --> 00:47:14.372
So I decided
to go see mitsuha in person.

00:47:14.583 --> 00:47:18.121
I wanted to meet her. But...

00:47:19.292 --> 00:47:24.582
What? You don't know where?
The town's scenery is your only clue?

00:47:24.792 --> 00:47:26.202
Yes.

00:47:28.458 --> 00:47:31.780
And you can't contact her?
What's this all about?

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.616
Seriously. What a lousy tour planner.

00:47:34.833 --> 00:47:35.993
I didn't plan any tour!

00:47:36.208 --> 00:47:39.450
Oh, well. We'll help you look for her.

00:47:39.667 --> 00:47:42.704
Oh, how cute! Look!

00:47:42.917 --> 00:47:43.917
So annoying.

00:47:43.958 --> 00:47:45.664
Oh, it moved!

00:48:13.958 --> 00:48:16.040
So it's impossible after all...

00:48:16.250 --> 00:48:20.448
What? After all the trouble
we went through?

00:48:22.917 --> 00:48:25.408
You haven't done anything.

00:48:30.167 --> 00:48:31.452
A takayama ramen.

00:48:31.667 --> 00:48:33.282
Oh, then a takayama ramen.

00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:37.493
Okay. Three ramens. Okay.

00:48:38.750 --> 00:48:40.991
Can we return to Tokyo today?

00:48:41.208 --> 00:48:44.245
We could be cutting it close. I'll check.

00:48:44.458 --> 00:48:45.197
Thanks.

00:48:45.417 --> 00:48:48.284
Are you all right with that?

00:48:50.375 --> 00:48:54.789
I'm starting to feel like
I'm barking up the wrong tree.

00:48:58.833 --> 00:49:02.701
Why, young man, that's itomori, isn't it?

00:49:03.792 --> 00:49:07.660
It's a very good drawing. Isn't it, dear?

00:49:08.667 --> 00:49:12.034
Yeah, it's itomori. Brings back memories.

00:49:12.250 --> 00:49:14.457
He was born in itomori.

00:49:14.667 --> 00:49:16.453
Itomori...?

00:49:17.792 --> 00:49:22.616
Yes! Itomori town!
That's it! It's nearby, isn't it?

00:49:22.833 --> 00:49:25.620
What are you... ltomori was...

00:49:25.833 --> 00:49:28.290
Itomori? No way!

00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:31.458
Is it where that comet...?

00:49:39.375 --> 00:49:42.367
"Keep out"

00:50:20.625 --> 00:50:23.742
Hey. Is this really the place?

00:50:23.958 --> 00:50:27.871
No way! Taki must be misremembering.

00:50:28.083 --> 00:50:31.780
No. I'm sure this is it.

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:37.415
This schoolyard. The mountains.
I remember this high school clearly!

00:50:37.625 --> 00:50:39.411
That can't be true!

00:50:39.625 --> 00:50:45.291
Surely you remember that disaster
three years ago, where hundreds died?

00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:47.661
Died?

00:50:47.875 --> 00:50:51.447
Died, three years ago?

00:50:53.083 --> 00:50:54.493
That can't be.

00:50:54.708 --> 00:50:59.156
I still have the notes
that she left behind...

00:51:16.167 --> 00:51:17.748
They're disappearing...

00:51:27.083 --> 00:51:29.950
Comet tiamat, with an
orbital period of 1,200 years,

00:51:29.958 --> 00:51:30.492
ee ee inca mt oe nr in sl ra

00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:30.704
"itomori, the town that vanished"

00:51:30.708 --> 00:51:34.621
"itomori, the town that vanished"

00:51:34.625 --> 00:51:34.704
"itomori, the town that vanished"

00:51:34.833 --> 00:51:34.912
nobody could predict that its nucleus
would split at its perigee.

00:51:34.917 --> 00:51:38.705
"Meteor strikes, wipes out town" nobody could predict
that its nucleus would split at its perigee.

00:51:38.708 --> 00:51:40.268
Nobody could predict that its nucleus
would split at its perigee.

00:51:40.292 --> 00:51:41.748
"Town annihilated"

00:51:41.958 --> 00:51:43.494
"over 500 dead or missing"

00:51:43.708 --> 00:51:45.073
"itomori, the town that vanished"

00:51:46.583 --> 00:51:50.326
a fragment of the comet
became a meteor that struck Japan.

00:51:50.333 --> 00:51:50.662
A fragment of the comet
became a meteor that struck Japan.

00:51:50.667 --> 00:51:52.328
"Itomori, comet, damage"

00:51:52.333 --> 00:51:53.197
"itomori, comet, damage"
it was the day of the Autumn festival.

00:51:53.208 --> 00:51:56.280
It was the day of the Autumn festival.

00:51:56.500 --> 00:51:59.242
The point of impact was here.

00:51:59.458 --> 00:52:05.158
At 8:42 P.M., it struck where people
were gathered for the festival.

00:52:07.208 --> 00:52:08.869
"Names of the victims"

00:52:08.875 --> 00:52:10.706
ee oe I ee = se re re ee ce ee eira
re eee eee ee ee ar =f ff = =f

00:52:10.708 --> 00:52:12.994
over 500 people died,
a third of the town's population,

00:52:13.208 --> 00:52:17.406
and now nobody
lives in itomori anymore.

00:52:29.708 --> 00:52:32.324
"Mitsuha miyamizu"

00:52:32.333 --> 00:52:34.198
"mitsuha miyamizu"

00:52:34.208 --> 00:52:34.242
that's her?

00:52:34.458 --> 00:52:39.248
It has to be some kind of mistake.
This person died three years ago!

00:52:39.458 --> 00:52:45.704
Just two, three weeks ago, she said to me
that the comet would be visible!

00:52:45.917 --> 00:52:46.702
So...

00:52:46.917 --> 00:52:49.033
You're dreaming right now...

00:52:50.208 --> 00:52:52.574
Aren't you?

00:52:56.083 --> 00:52:58.074
What did I...?

00:53:11.667 --> 00:53:13.453
Lively up there.

00:53:13.667 --> 00:53:16.079
I'm sorry we could only get one room.

00:53:16.292 --> 00:53:18.658
No problem.

00:53:18.875 --> 00:53:19.875
How's taki?

00:53:19.917 --> 00:53:22.989
He's still reading articles on itomori.

00:53:23.208 --> 00:53:27.030
Newspapers and magazines
from back then, whatever he can find.

00:53:31.667 --> 00:53:35.159
What?
Nothing. I didn't know you smoked.

00:53:35.375 --> 00:53:39.243
Oh. I had quit, but...

00:53:39.458 --> 00:53:42.950
What do you think about taki's story?

00:53:45.833 --> 00:53:48.324
I liked him.

00:53:48.542 --> 00:53:54.663
The way he was recently. He was always
a nice guy, but even more so lately.

00:53:54.875 --> 00:53:59.289
Like he was trying so hard. It was cute.

00:53:59.500 --> 00:54:03.743
What he's saying
doesn't make sense to me...

00:54:05.875 --> 00:54:11.575
But I'm sure he met someone,
and that someone changed him.

00:54:12.792 --> 00:54:13.702
That much is for sure, I think.

00:54:13.708 --> 00:54:16.290
"Worst-ever itomori comet disaster"
that much is for sure, I think.

00:54:16.292 --> 00:54:17.692
"Worst-ever itomori comet disaster"

00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:33.072
It was all just a dream.

00:54:33.292 --> 00:54:40.039
I recognized the scenery because
I remembered the news from three years ago.

00:54:40.250 --> 00:54:43.538
If not that, then... a ghost?

00:54:43.750 --> 00:54:48.915
No... was I delusional?

00:54:52.417 --> 00:54:56.535
Her name... what was it?

00:54:58.833 --> 00:55:01.540
Tsukasa went to take a bath.

00:55:01.750 --> 00:55:05.288
Oh, Ms. okudera. I, uh...

00:55:05.500 --> 00:55:11.700
I've been saying such strange things.
Thank you for coming along today.

00:55:15.208 --> 00:55:16.698
No problem.

00:55:16.708 --> 00:55:16.742
Sere ames ee

00:55:16.750 --> 00:55:18.115

00:55:18.333 --> 00:55:19.994
"the braided cords of ltomori"

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:21.206
"the braided cords of itomori"

00:55:21.208 --> 00:55:22.948
braided cords. How pretty.

00:55:23.167 --> 00:55:26.989
Is that a braided cord you're wearing?

00:55:27.208 --> 00:55:33.078
Oh, this... I think someone
gave it to me a long time ago.

00:55:33.292 --> 00:55:37.331
I wear it sometimes
as kind of a lucky charm...

00:55:39.417 --> 00:55:42.534
Who was it?

00:55:42.750 --> 00:55:45.742
Why don't you go take a bath, too?

00:55:45.958 --> 00:55:48.324
Yes. No.

00:55:50.708 --> 00:55:55.247
Someone who makes
braided cords once told me...

00:55:55.458 --> 00:55:58.370
The cords represent
the flow of time itself.

00:55:58.583 --> 00:56:04.988
The threads twist, tangle, unravel,
and connect again. That's time...

00:56:06.875 --> 00:56:08.581
Maybe at that place...

00:56:26.208 --> 00:56:28.824
"Around here?"

00:56:34.208 --> 00:56:36.164
Taki.

00:56:36.375 --> 00:56:38.331
Taki.

00:56:38.542 --> 00:56:40.157
Taki.

00:56:41.208 --> 00:56:43.699
Don't you remember me?

00:56:57.458 --> 00:57:02.452
"I have to go somewhere. Go back to Tokyo
without me. I'll return later. Thanks."

00:57:05.708 --> 00:57:07.244
Taki...

00:57:30.833 --> 00:57:33.950
Eat this up there.

00:57:34.167 --> 00:57:38.536
Your drawing of itomori... it was good.

00:58:15.292 --> 00:58:19.956
They converge and take shape.
They twist, tangle,

00:58:20.167 --> 00:58:24.661
sometimes unravel, then connect again...

00:58:24.875 --> 00:58:29.869
Musubi: Knotting. That's time.

00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:41.240
There it is!

00:58:43.042 --> 00:58:45.954
It's really there!

00:58:46.167 --> 00:58:49.034
It wasn't just a dream!

00:59:19.375 --> 00:59:22.367
Beyond this is the underworld.

00:59:45.458 --> 00:59:48.416
It's the saké we brought.

00:59:49.458 --> 00:59:53.076
This is yotsuha's, and this is mitsuha's.

00:59:55.667 --> 01:00:03.667
Before the comet struck... so the mitsuha
I know is from three years ago?

01:00:04.333 --> 01:00:08.155
Our timelines were out of step.

01:00:09.042 --> 01:00:11.158
Half of her...

01:00:25.875 --> 01:00:28.412
Musubi.

01:00:28.625 --> 01:00:32.288
If time can really be turned back,

01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:34.582
give me one last chance...

01:00:48.667 --> 01:00:50.623
A comet!

01:01:55.250 --> 01:01:58.617
Your name is mitsuha.

01:02:04.833 --> 01:02:07.119
You're both my treasures.

01:02:07.333 --> 01:02:09.619
You're a big sister now.

01:02:09.625 --> 01:02:10.159
You're a big sister now.

01:02:10.167 --> 01:02:12.078
"Get well soon, mom."

01:02:12.292 --> 01:02:15.125
I'm so sorry, my dears.

01:02:16.333 --> 01:02:20.747
Dad, when is mom going to come home?

01:02:20.958 --> 01:02:21.958
I couldn't save her.

01:02:22.167 --> 01:02:24.078
Get a hold of yourself!

01:02:24.292 --> 01:02:25.577
Who cares about the shrine?

01:02:25.792 --> 01:02:27.202
You're the adopted son-in-law!

01:02:27.417 --> 01:02:30.454
I loved my wife futaba.
Not miyamizu shrine!

01:02:30.667 --> 01:02:32.248
Get out of here!

01:02:34.458 --> 01:02:37.040
Mitsuha, yotsuha,

01:02:37.250 --> 01:02:40.868
you'll be with grandma from now on.

01:02:45.208 --> 01:02:45.446
Who am 1? No, who are you?

01:02:45.458 --> 01:02:46.447
Who am 1? No, who are you?

01:02:46.458 --> 01:02:46.662
Who am 1? No, who are you?

01:02:46.667 --> 01:02:47.747
Who am 1? No, who are you?

01:02:47.750 --> 01:02:47.954
Who am 1? No, who are you?

01:02:47.958 --> 01:02:48.117
Who am 1? No, who are you?

01:02:48.125 --> 01:02:48.329

He's so lucky.
They must be together right about now...

01:02:57.750 --> 01:02:58.865
I'm going to Tokyo.

01:02:59.083 --> 01:03:00.994
What? Hey, mitsuha!

01:03:03.250 --> 01:03:07.163
Grandma, could you do me a favor?

01:03:07.958 --> 01:03:10.870
Oh, yeah, the comet.

01:03:11.083 --> 01:03:13.870
Today's the peak of its brightness...

01:03:14.083 --> 01:03:16.995
Mitsuha! Don't stay there!

01:03:17.208 --> 01:03:21.781
Mitsuha, get out of there
before the comet strikes!

01:03:24.167 --> 01:03:26.704
Mitsuha, get out of there!

01:03:26.917 --> 01:03:29.329
Mitsuha! Mitsuha!

01:03:29.542 --> 01:03:31.908
Mitsuha!

01:03:49.750 --> 01:03:53.072
I'm mitsuha! She's still alive!

01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:06.662
Mitsuha, are you touching...

01:04:08.375 --> 01:04:10.206
My sister!

01:04:12.292 --> 01:04:14.829
Yotsuhal!

01:04:17.375 --> 01:04:20.117
Mitsuha has finally lost it.

01:04:20.333 --> 01:04:22.915
I'm leaving without her.

01:04:23.125 --> 01:04:24.990
She's lost it.

01:04:25.208 --> 01:04:27.620
She's completely lost it.

01:04:27.833 --> 01:04:29.118
Scary.

01:04:29.333 --> 01:04:33.622
Comet tiamat has been visible
to the naked eye for a few days now.

01:04:33.833 --> 01:04:37.576
Tonight it will finally reach
its perigee around 7:40 P.M.,

01:04:37.792 --> 01:04:40.329
and will achieve its maximum brightness.

01:04:40.542 --> 01:04:43.864
It's tonight. There's still time.

01:04:44.083 --> 01:04:46.074
Good morning, mitsuha.

01:04:46.292 --> 01:04:48.283
Oh...

01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:52.038
You're not mitsuha, are you?

01:04:52.250 --> 01:04:55.742
You knew, grandma?

01:04:55.958 --> 01:05:03.205
No, but watching the way you've behaved
lately triggered some memories.

01:05:03.417 --> 01:05:09.743
I also remember having
strange dreams when I was a young girl.

01:05:09.958 --> 01:05:16.204
Although now I've forgotten
whose life I was dreaming about.

01:05:16.417 --> 01:05:17.452
Forgotten...

01:05:17.667 --> 01:05:22.991
Treasure the experience.
Dreams fade away after you wake up.

01:05:23.208 --> 01:05:28.498
Your mother and I
both went through similar phases.

01:05:28.708 --> 01:05:32.826
Maybe those dreams
that the miyamizu family had

01:05:33.042 --> 01:05:36.239
were all for what will happen today.

01:05:36.458 --> 01:05:38.824
Grandma, listen.

01:05:39.042 --> 01:05:44.491
A comet will strike itomori tonight
and everyone will die!

01:05:51.292 --> 01:05:56.787
"Nobody will believe that"? What a
surprisingly ordinary reply, grandma.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.787
I won't let them die!

01:06:00.458 --> 01:06:02.915
Oh! What happened, mitsuha?

01:06:03.125 --> 01:06:07.448
Your... your hair!

01:06:07.667 --> 01:06:10.033
Oh, this. It looked better before, huh?

01:06:10.250 --> 01:06:11.660
That's it?

01:06:11.875 --> 01:06:16.198
Forget that! If nothing is done,
everyone will die tonight!

01:06:18.292 --> 01:06:20.908
So we have to act!

01:06:25.250 --> 01:06:26.956
Why aren't you at school?

01:06:27.167 --> 01:06:32.116
Uh... we have to save the town.

01:06:33.417 --> 01:06:34.617
The community wireless system?

01:06:34.750 --> 01:06:37.492
Yeah, those speakers you see everywhere.

01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:37.659
"Superimposition, frequency"
yeah, those speakers you see everywhere.

01:06:37.667 --> 01:06:40.909
"Superimposition, frequency"

01:06:41.875 --> 01:06:45.663
I see! That could work!
You're awesome, Tessie!

01:06:45.875 --> 01:06:48.241
Hey! Not so close!

01:06:48.458 --> 01:06:50.574
What, embarrassed? Hey, hey!

01:06:50.792 --> 01:06:54.034
Stop! You're a girl of marriageable age!

01:06:54.417 --> 01:06:55.953
"Club discontinued - keep out"

01:06:55.958 --> 01:06:56.913
"club discontinued - keep out”

01:06:56.917 --> 01:06:58.623
you're such a nice guy!

01:07:02.042 --> 01:07:04.124
Got them. Here's your change.

01:07:04.333 --> 01:07:05.539
Sorry, Sayaka.

01:07:05.750 --> 01:07:07.081
It's all right.

01:07:07.292 --> 01:07:10.284
What a cheap fee. Deal with it.

01:07:11.583 --> 01:07:15.952
What about you? Have you
come up with an escape plan?

01:07:18.917 --> 01:07:21.704
What? A bomb?

01:07:21.917 --> 01:07:26.160
We have water gel explosives
for construction at our storage site.

01:07:26.375 --> 01:07:27.911
Broadcast hijacking?

01:07:28.125 --> 01:07:32.744
The town's wireless system can be
hijacked easily with the startup frequency.

01:07:32.958 --> 01:07:36.951
So we can broadcast
an evacuation warning from the school.

01:07:37.167 --> 01:07:42.287
The school is outside the disaster area,
so people can evacuate here.

01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:44.957
It's... it's totally a crime!

01:07:45.167 --> 01:07:46.623
You do the broadcast.

01:07:46.833 --> 01:07:49.370
Why?
You're in the broadcast club.

01:07:49.583 --> 01:07:51.119
I'm in charge of explosives.

01:07:51.333 --> 01:07:53.745
I'll go talk to the mayor.

01:07:53.958 --> 01:07:57.655
In the end, the city council
has to evacuate everyone.

01:07:57.875 --> 01:08:00.833
I'm his daughter. I can persuade him.

01:08:01.042 --> 01:08:03.328
It's a perfect plan.

01:08:04.333 --> 01:08:08.997
Oh, whatever. It's just
a what-if fantasy, isn't it?

01:08:09.208 --> 01:08:11.290
What? Well...

01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:15.664
Not necessarily! Do you know
how lake itomori was formed?

01:08:15.667 --> 01:08:15.871
Not necessarily! Do you know

01:08:15.875 --> 01:08:16.079
"a meteor crater lake
formed 1,200 years ago."

01:08:16.083 --> 01:08:19.655
"A meteor crater lake formed 1,200 years ago." It's a meteor
crater! So one did strike this area a thousand years ago!

01:08:19.667 --> 01:08:21.643
It's a meteor crater! So one did
strike this area a thousand years ago!

01:08:21.667 --> 01:08:23.623
Oh! So that's why...

01:08:23.833 --> 01:08:25.824
You're right, Tessie!

01:08:29.417 --> 01:08:31.749
Let's do this together!
Let's do this together!

01:08:35.333 --> 01:08:38.120
What on earth are you talking about?

01:08:39.875 --> 01:08:43.322
I said, we have to evacuate
everyone in town before tonight or...

01:08:43.542 --> 01:08:45.453
Shut your mouth.

01:08:50.625 --> 01:08:53.913
"The comet will split and strike the town"?

01:08:53.917 --> 01:08:53.996
"Itomori town hall"
"the comet will split and strike the town"?

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.000
"Itomori town hall"

01:08:56.917 --> 01:08:57.030
"over 500 people will die"?

01:08:57.250 --> 01:09:00.538
How dare you spout such nonsense?

01:09:00.750 --> 01:09:04.038
If you're serious, then you're sick.

01:09:04.250 --> 01:09:08.243
Madness must be from the miyamizu side.

01:09:08.458 --> 01:09:12.827
I'll get someone to drive you
to a hospital in the city.

01:09:13.042 --> 01:09:16.910
I'll listen to you
after a doctor examines you.

01:09:20.083 --> 01:09:21.948
You son of a...!

01:09:30.083 --> 01:09:34.326
Mitsuha! No...

01:09:34.542 --> 01:09:37.158
Who...

01:09:37.375 --> 01:09:39.036
Who are you?

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.036
See you later at the festival.

01:09:55.250 --> 01:09:56.865
Let's meet at the shrine.

01:09:57.083 --> 01:09:58.083
Don't be late. Bye!

01:09:58.292 --> 01:10:00.283
See you. Later.

01:10:01.417 --> 01:10:03.123
Don't go!

01:10:03.333 --> 01:10:05.745
Get out of town. Tell your friends!

01:10:05.958 --> 01:10:07.038
What are you saying?

01:10:07.250 --> 01:10:09.206
Mitsuha! What was that?

01:10:09.208 --> 01:10:10.823
Let's go. What was that?

01:10:11.042 --> 01:10:13.624
What are you doing?

01:10:13.833 --> 01:10:15.539
Could mitsuha...

01:10:15.750 --> 01:10:19.618
Could she have persuaded them?
Is it my fault?

01:10:19.833 --> 01:10:23.746
Yotsuha, leave town
with grandma before nightfall.

01:10:23.958 --> 01:10:25.448
You'll die if you stay here!

01:10:25.667 --> 01:10:27.532
What are you saying?

01:10:27.750 --> 01:10:32.665
Yesterday you suddenly went to Tokyo.
What's wrong with you?

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.285
Tokyo?

01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:38.458
Hey, mitsuhal!

01:10:40.375 --> 01:10:42.832
How did it go with your old man?

01:10:44.625 --> 01:10:46.616
Hey, mitsuha?

01:10:46.833 --> 01:10:48.118
What's wrong with her?

01:10:48.333 --> 01:10:49.914
No idea.

01:10:59.542 --> 01:11:01.908
Are you there?

01:11:02.125 --> 01:11:04.582
Is something over there?

01:11:04.792 --> 01:11:06.123
Let me use your bike.

01:11:06.333 --> 01:11:07.333
Hey, what the...

01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:08.956
Hey, mitsuhal!

01:11:09.958 --> 01:11:11.118
What about our plan?

01:11:11.333 --> 01:11:13.540
Get ready as planned!

01:11:13.750 --> 01:11:15.456
Please!

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:44.413
I'm taki again.

01:11:47.125 --> 01:11:49.992
What's taki doing here?

01:11:59.083 --> 01:12:00.823
The town...

01:12:01.042 --> 01:12:02.828
Is gone.

01:12:11.833 --> 01:12:16.076
At that moment... did I...

01:12:18.792 --> 01:12:20.874
Die?

01:12:30.083 --> 01:12:33.780
Taki. Taki.

01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:38.082
Don't you remember me?

01:12:49.792 --> 01:12:51.657
I'm going to Tokyo.

01:12:51.875 --> 01:12:53.411
What? Now?

01:12:53.625 --> 01:12:54.990
Why?

01:12:55.208 --> 01:12:56.208
A date.

01:12:56.417 --> 01:12:58.453
You have a boyfriend in Tokyo?

01:12:58.667 --> 01:13:01.158
Not my date.

01:13:02.125 --> 01:13:04.161
I'll come home tonight.

01:13:06.792 --> 01:13:12.082
If I suddenly showed up,
would I bother him? Surprise him?

01:13:12.292 --> 01:13:15.329
He might not like it.

01:13:22.625 --> 01:13:26.163
The phone you are trying to reach
is out of range or...

01:13:26.375 --> 01:13:28.206
There's no way we could meet.

01:13:28.417 --> 01:13:31.159
But what if we did?

01:13:31.375 --> 01:13:35.948
What should I do? Would I annoy him?
Would it be awkward?

01:13:35.958 --> 01:13:36.287
"Tiamat makes closest approach tomorrow" what should
I do? Would I annoy him? Would it be awkward?

01:13:36.292 --> 01:13:36.496
"Tiamat makes
closest approach tomorrow"

01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:38.957
"tiamat makes
closest approach tomorrow"

01:13:38.958 --> 01:13:39.322
or maybe...

01:13:39.542 --> 01:13:43.285
He'd be a bit glad to see me?

01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:48.244
The phone you are trying to reach
is out of range or...

01:13:48.458 --> 01:13:51.746
There's no way we could meet.

01:13:51.958 --> 01:13:53.368
But...

01:13:54.667 --> 01:13:57.864
One thing is certain.

01:13:58.083 --> 01:14:02.656
If we see each other, we'll know.

01:14:02.875 --> 01:14:06.868
That you were the one who was inside me.

01:14:07.083 --> 01:14:10.041
That I was the one who was inside you.

01:14:10.250 --> 01:14:11.865
I'm sorry.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.161
Excuse me.

01:15:16.708 --> 01:15:21.452
That time three years ago,
before I got to know you...

01:15:24.542 --> 01:15:26.749
Taki.

01:15:26.958 --> 01:15:30.030
Taki.

01:15:30.250 --> 01:15:31.660
Taki.

01:15:32.625 --> 01:15:36.743
Um... it's me.

01:15:36.958 --> 01:15:40.371
Don't you remember me?

01:15:40.583 --> 01:15:42.574
Who are you?

01:15:46.792 --> 01:15:48.657
I'm sorry.

01:15:55.833 --> 01:15:58.245
But he's taki.

01:15:58.458 --> 01:16:00.494
Weird girl.

01:16:09.208 --> 01:16:11.164
Hey!

01:16:11.375 --> 01:16:13.206
What's your name?

01:16:13.417 --> 01:16:14.748
Mitsuha!

01:16:14.958 --> 01:16:18.030
My name is mitsuha!

01:16:24.458 --> 01:16:29.907
That time three years ago, you came...

01:16:30.125 --> 01:16:32.241
To see me!

01:16:42.875 --> 01:16:44.661
Taki?

01:16:52.458 --> 01:16:55.370
Mitsuha!

01:16:55.583 --> 01:16:57.198
Taki?

01:17:11.167 --> 01:17:13.078
Mitsuha!

01:17:13.292 --> 01:17:17.410
You're here, aren't you? Inside my body!

01:17:17.625 --> 01:17:19.411
Taki!

01:17:19.625 --> 01:17:22.207
Taki, where are you?

01:17:22.417 --> 01:17:23.782
It's mitsuha.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.707
I can hear her, but...

01:17:26.917 --> 01:17:30.080
Taki, where are you?

01:17:30.292 --> 01:17:32.032
Taki!

01:17:44.542 --> 01:17:47.909
Taki, are you...

01:17:48.125 --> 01:17:49.956
There?

01:18:14.250 --> 01:18:16.457
It's twilight.

01:18:31.042 --> 01:18:32.703
Mitsuha.

01:18:38.542 --> 01:18:40.908
Taki.

01:18:41.125 --> 01:18:45.368
Taki. It's really you.

01:18:48.750 --> 01:18:49.750
Taki!

01:18:49.875 --> 01:18:52.161
I came to see you.

01:18:52.375 --> 01:18:56.243
It wasn't easy.
You were so far away.

01:18:56.458 --> 01:19:01.202
But how? At that moment, I...

01:19:01.417 --> 01:19:04.489
I drank your kuchikamizake.

01:19:07.875 --> 01:19:10.947
You drank that?

01:19:11.167 --> 01:19:13.158
You idiot! Pervert!

01:19:13.375 --> 01:19:16.208
Oh, yeah, and you touched my boobs!

01:19:16.417 --> 01:19:18.282
How do you know that?

01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:20.081
Yotsuha saw it.

01:19:20.292 --> 01:19:23.864
Oh! Sorry, I couldn't help it!
It was just once.

01:19:24.083 --> 01:19:26.074
Just once?

01:19:27.792 --> 01:19:30.124
Doesn't matter how many times! Jerk.

01:19:30.333 --> 01:19:31.573
Sorry.

01:19:31.792 --> 01:19:34.204
Oh, this...

01:19:34.417 --> 01:19:38.706
Oh. Really, why'd you
come see me before I knew you?

01:19:38.917 --> 01:19:40.748
There's no way I'd recognize you.

01:19:40.958 --> 01:19:45.327
Here. I kept it for three years.

01:19:45.542 --> 01:19:48.614
Now you keep it.

01:19:48.833 --> 01:19:50.243
Yes.

01:19:57.833 --> 01:19:59.448
How is it?

01:20:00.250 --> 01:20:01.740
Not bad.

01:20:01.958 --> 01:20:02.993
You're lying!

01:20:03.208 --> 01:20:05.574
No, I... sorry.

01:20:05.792 --> 01:20:08.374
You're just so...!

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:24.948
Mitsuha, you still
have things to do. Listen.

01:20:27.792 --> 01:20:29.157
It's coming.

01:20:29.375 --> 01:20:31.661
Don't worry. You've still got time.

01:20:31.875 --> 01:20:35.914
Yes, I'll try.

01:20:36.125 --> 01:20:38.286
Kataware-doki is almost...

01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:39.990
Over.

01:20:41.792 --> 01:20:45.990
Hey, mitsuha. So we don't
forget when we wake up...

01:20:50.250 --> 01:20:53.947
Let's write our names on each other. Here.

01:20:55.417 --> 01:20:56.827
Okay!

01:21:05.958 --> 01:21:09.246
Mitsuha?

01:21:09.458 --> 01:21:11.744
Hey, mitsuha?

01:21:20.125 --> 01:21:23.413
I wanted to tell you.

01:21:23.625 --> 01:21:29.416
Wherever you are in the world,
I'll come find you.

01:21:32.167 --> 01:21:35.955
Your name is mitsuha.

01:21:36.167 --> 01:21:38.453
It's okay. I remember.

01:21:38.667 --> 01:21:42.410
Mitsuha. Mitsuha. Mitsuha.
Your name is mitsuha.

01:21:42.625 --> 01:21:44.991
Your name is...

01:21:54.583 --> 01:21:58.531
Who are you?

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:03.538
Why did I come here?

01:22:03.750 --> 01:22:06.913
I came here to see her.

01:22:07.125 --> 01:22:11.198
To save her. I wanted her to be alive.

01:22:11.417 --> 01:22:16.332
Who was it? Who? Who did I come to see?

01:22:16.542 --> 01:22:20.581
Someone dear to me. I don't
want to forget. I shouldn't forget!

01:22:21.750 --> 01:22:26.540
Who? Who? Who? Who?

01:22:26.750 --> 01:22:28.786
What's your name?

01:22:43.375 --> 01:22:46.617
Taki. Taki. Taki.

01:22:46.833 --> 01:22:50.906
It's okay. I remember. I'll never forget!

01:22:51.125 --> 01:22:53.366
Taki. Taki.

01:22:53.583 --> 01:22:56.996
Your name is taki!

01:23:06.458 --> 01:23:08.449
"Itomori substation"

01:23:10.875 --> 01:23:12.411
Tessie!

01:23:12.625 --> 01:23:15.116
Mitsuha! Where've you been?

01:23:15.333 --> 01:23:17.449
He said sorry for breaking your bike.

01:23:17.667 --> 01:23:20.784
[Huh? Who did? I did.

01:23:21.792 --> 01:23:24.499
Explain everything to me later.

01:23:28.292 --> 01:23:30.783
That's going to fall? Really?

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.116
Yes! Saw it with my own eyes!

01:23:33.333 --> 01:23:35.790
What? You saw it, huh?

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:41.825

Now we're both criminals!

When the town's power goes out,
the equipment there should work on backup.

01:23:52.542 --> 01:23:55.579
Please, Sayaka!
Repeat it as much as you can!

01:23:55.792 --> 01:23:58.454
Woo-hoo! You can do it!

Oh, to heck with it!

01:24:21.208 --> 01:24:22.914

This is itomori town hall.

An explosion
has occurred at the substation.

01:25:09.750 --> 01:25:13.993
There is a danger of further
explosions and forest fires.

01:25:14.208 --> 01:25:20.784
Residents in the following areas,
please evacuate to itomori high school.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:25.664

01:25:25.875 --> 01:25:28.947

Who is it, then?

01:25:38.167 --> 01:25:39.577

01:25:45.917 --> 01:25:48.078
Run, everybody! Forest fire!

01:25:48.292 --> 01:25:51.125
Forest fire! Please evacuate!

01:25:51.333 --> 01:25:52.333
Run! Fire!

01:25:52.417 --> 01:25:55.955
It's not safe here! Please evacuate!

01:25:56.750 --> 01:26:00.038
We don't have enough time! Mitsuha!

01:26:01.250 --> 01:26:02.990
What's wrong?

01:26:03.208 --> 01:26:07.952
His name... I can't remember his name!

01:26:09.875 --> 01:26:13.743
Look, how should I know?
You started all this!

01:26:13.958 --> 01:26:16.916
We can't evacuate
everyone by ourselves!

01:26:17.125 --> 01:26:19.958
Go persuade your father!

01:26:27.792 --> 01:26:31.489
Everybody run! Go to the high school!

01:26:33.667 --> 01:26:35.783
Oh, mitsuha.

01:26:38.375 --> 01:26:41.492
It's no terrorist attack!
What's chubu electric saying?

01:26:41.708 --> 01:26:43.198
They're still checking!

01:26:43.417 --> 01:26:46.614
No forest fire yet? Are you sure?

01:26:46.833 --> 01:26:48.243
Okay!

01:26:49.167 --> 01:26:53.035
Stop this broadcast!
Figure out where it's coming from!

01:26:53.250 --> 01:26:56.663

01:26:58.833 --> 01:27:04.624
Again, residents in the following areas,
evacuate to itomori high sch... oh!

01:27:04.833 --> 01:27:07.950
What are you doing? Turn that off!

01:27:09.625 --> 01:27:10.625
Sayaka!

01:27:10.708 --> 01:27:12.539
Oh, no.

01:27:15.500 --> 01:27:18.207
What have you done, Sayaka?

01:27:21.583 --> 01:27:25.496
This is itomori town hall.

01:27:25.708 --> 01:27:29.656
We are currently looking into the accident.

01:27:29.875 --> 01:27:34.744
Please don't panic. Stay where you are
and await further instructions.

01:27:34.958 --> 01:27:36.573
Stay put, they said.

01:27:36.792 --> 01:27:39.829
What's going on? So we stay put?

01:27:40.042 --> 01:27:44.991
Come on, you should all evacuate!
The high school is the shelter!

01:27:45.208 --> 01:27:46.698
Katsuhiko!

01:27:49.583 --> 01:27:52.416
What are you doing?

01:27:55.208 --> 01:27:57.915
Sorry, mitsuha.

01:27:58.125 --> 01:28:00.116
It's over.

01:28:01.833 --> 01:28:05.746
It really is splitting apart!

01:28:11.958 --> 01:28:13.494
Look at that! - Wow!

01:28:13.708 --> 01:28:16.620
Look! The comet has split in two

01:28:16.833 --> 01:28:18.448
and meteors are falling!

01:28:18.667 --> 01:28:21.204
Nobody predicted this.

01:28:21.417 --> 01:28:22.897
We have a really mystical sight here.

01:28:23.083 --> 01:28:24.823
So the comet's nucleus split?

01:28:25.042 --> 01:28:26.202
Did tidal forces affect...

01:28:26.417 --> 01:28:31.161
The comet isn't within the roche limit,
so the nucleus itself must have...

01:28:31.375 --> 01:28:36.699
In the past, comet shoemaker-Levy 9
broke and collided with Jupiter in 1994.

01:28:36.917 --> 01:28:38.202
At least 21 fragments...

01:28:38.417 --> 01:28:40.829
I'm going to go look!

01:28:41.042 --> 01:28:44.534
They will probably melt
before reaching the ground

01:28:44.750 --> 01:28:48.868
and the probability of a meteor crashing
into a residential area is small...

01:28:49.083 --> 01:28:50.573
To predict the trajectory...

01:28:50.792 --> 01:28:54.080
To be witnessing such
a magnificent celestial event, and...

01:28:54.292 --> 01:28:56.954
How fortunate it is

01:28:57.167 --> 01:29:02.161
that those of us living in this
day and age are watching this live.

01:29:04.167 --> 01:29:07.739
Hey. Who are you?

01:29:11.333 --> 01:29:13.494
Who? Who?

01:29:13.708 --> 01:29:15.369
Who is that?

01:29:15.583 --> 01:29:20.953
Someone dear to me. I shouldn't forget.
I didn't want to forget!

01:29:21.833 --> 01:29:26.497
Who? Who? Who are you?

01:29:26.708 --> 01:29:28.699
What's your name?

01:29:35.250 --> 01:29:37.081
It's split!

01:29:56.083 --> 01:30:01.578
So we don't forget when we wake up,
let's write our names on each other.

01:30:09.667 --> 01:30:13.114
"I love you"

01:30:28.125 --> 01:30:33.245
I can't remember your name with this...

01:30:45.917 --> 01:30:47.407
Dad!

01:30:49.208 --> 01:30:51.164
Mitsuha! Mitsuha!

01:30:51.375 --> 01:30:53.457
Not you again...

01:30:57.208 --> 01:31:00.780
It was almost as if
it were a scene from a dream.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:05.414
Nothing more, nothing less
than a beautiful view.

01:32:36.458 --> 01:32:43.364
What am I doing here?

01:33:14.750 --> 01:33:18.288
I'm always searching for something.

01:33:18.500 --> 01:33:22.789
This feeling has
possessed me for some time.

01:33:24.417 --> 01:33:26.248
I applied because...

01:33:26.458 --> 01:33:27.868
The landscapes people live in...

01:33:28.083 --> 01:33:29.869
To build a city's landscape...

01:33:30.083 --> 01:33:33.951
You never know when Tokyo
might disappear as well.

01:33:34.167 --> 01:33:40.538
So I want to help build landscapes
that leave heartwarming memories...

01:33:42.458 --> 01:33:44.574
How many interviews have you had?

01:33:44.792 --> 01:33:45.792
I haven't kept track.

01:33:45.958 --> 01:33:48.244
Can't see you landing a job.
Thanks a lot!

01:33:48.458 --> 01:33:49.994
Maybe it's the suit.

01:33:50.208 --> 01:33:51.914
We're not that different!

01:33:52.125 --> 01:33:54.616

for a person or a place,

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:12.075
or if I'm just searching for a job.

Oh, you're job-hunting.

much from back then.

two returned to Tokyo without me.

01:41:19.542 --> 01:41:24.957
Usually harsh words of my father

01:41:25.167 --> 01:41:30.491
felt somehow warm today

01:41:30.708 --> 01:41:36.283
not knowing how to be kind
or smile or talk about dreams

01:41:36.500 --> 01:41:41.699
I had to imitate you all

01:41:41.917 --> 01:41:47.412
just a bit more, a little bit more,

01:41:47.625 --> 01:41:53.074
would you...

01:41:53.292 --> 01:41:58.741
Just a bit more, a little bit more,

01:41:58.958 --> 01:42:03.156
let's stick together

01:42:07.875 --> 01:42:12.790
we are time-flyer, we are time-climber

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:19.701
don't wanna be lost in its hide-and-seek

01:42:19.917 --> 01:42:23.910
you cry when you're happy
you laugh when you're sad

01:42:24.125 --> 01:42:28.869
because your heart overtook you

01:42:50.833 --> 01:42:56.408
The toy I used to wish for upon the stars

01:42:56.625 --> 01:43:01.949
is left lying on the floor
at the corner of my room

01:43:02.167 --> 01:43:07.833
I made my hundredth wish today

01:43:08.042 --> 01:43:13.867
I will trade them all to one thing some day

01:43:19.458 --> 01:43:24.998
Talked to a girl who's usually silent

01:43:25.208 --> 01:43:30.532
"see ya" I said after school

01:43:30.750 --> 01:43:36.370
it's nice for a change to break your habit

01:43:36.583 --> 01:43:41.748
especially when you are next to me

01:43:41.958 --> 01:43:47.407
just a bit more, a little bit more,

01:43:47.625 --> 01:43:53.120
would you...

01:43:53.333 --> 01:43:58.873
Just a bit more, a little bit more,

01:43:59.083 --> 01:44:03.281
stick together

01:44:07.917 --> 01:44:12.832
we are time-flyer, I knew who you are

01:44:13.042 --> 01:44:21.042
long before even I learned my name

01:44:25.917 --> 01:44:31.037
there must be a meaning
to the world without you

01:44:31.250 --> 01:44:37.120
but the world without you
is like August with no summer break

01:44:37.333 --> 01:44:42.828
like Santa claus with no ho-ho-ho's

01:44:43.042 --> 01:44:51.042
how pitiful if such were the world

01:45:16.500 --> 01:45:21.369
We are time-flyer, we are time-climber

01:45:21.583 --> 01:45:28.159
don't wanna be lost in its hide-and-seek

01:45:28.375 --> 01:45:32.493
it's really nothing,
yeah it's really nothing

01:45:32.708 --> 01:45:37.031
I'm on my way

01:45:37.250 --> 01:45:42.119
we are time-flyer, we are time-climber

01:45:42.333 --> 01:45:48.579
don't wanna be lost in its hide-and-seek

01:45:48.792 --> 01:45:53.536
you're a loud cryer, wish I could stop ya

01:45:53.750 --> 01:46:00.371
but when I saw your tears
I knew I was refused

01:46:00.583 --> 01:46:04.451
I cry when I'm happy
I laugh when I'm sad

01:46:04.667 --> 01:46:09.957
because my heart overtook me
